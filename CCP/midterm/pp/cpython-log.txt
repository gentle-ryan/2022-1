    Added PyMac_getscript() which returns the pythonic name of the current script. Not ideal and not complete, but good enough for the time being. Idea and most of the code by Fredrik Lund.

    Create a new section of pyport.h to hold all external function declarations
    for systems that are missing those declarations from system include files.
    Start by moving a pointy-haired ones from their previous locations to the
    new section.
    
    (The gethostname() one, for instance, breaks on several systems, because
    some define it as (char *, size_t) and some as (char *, int).)
    
    I purposely decided not to include the summary of used #defines like Tim did
    in the first section of pyport.h. In my opinion, the number of #defines
    likedly to be used by this section would make such an overview unwieldy. I
    would suggest documenting the non-obvious ones, though.

    Removed all instances of RETSIGTYPE from the source code:  signal
    handlers "return void", according to ANSI C.
    Removed the new Py_RETURN_FROM_SIGNAL_HANDLER macro.
    Left RETSIGTYPE in the config stuff, because it's not clear to
    me that others aren't relying on it (e.g., extension modules).

    Included assert.h in Python.h -- it's absurd that this basic tool of
    good C practice hasn't been available to everything all along.
    Added Py_SAFE_DOWNCAST(VALUE, WIDE, NARROW) macro to pyport.h; this
    just casts VALUE from type WIDE to type NARROW, but assert-fails if
    Py_DEBUG is defined and info is lost due to casting.
    Replaced a line in Fredrik's fix to marshal.c to use the new macro.

    Recent ANSIfication introduced a couple instances of
        #if RETSIGTYPE != void
    That isn't C, and MSVC properly refuses to compile it.
    Introduced new Py_RETURN_FROM_SIGNAL_HANDLER macro in pyport.h
    to expand to the correct thing based on RETSIGTYPE.  However,
    only void is ANSI!  Do we still have platforms that return int?
    The Unix config mess appears to #define RETSIGTYPE by magic
    without being asked to, so I assume it's "a problem" across
    Unices still.

    Bunch of minor ANSIfications: 'void initfunc()' -> 'void initfunc(void)',
    and a couple of functions that were missed in the previous batches. Not
    terribly tested, but very carefully scrutinized, three times.
    
    All these were found by the little findkrc.py that I posted to python-dev,
    which means there might be more lurking. Cases such as this:
    
    long
    func(a, b)
            long a;
            long b; /* flagword */
    {
    
    and other cases where the last ; in the argument list isn't followed by a
    newline and an opening curly bracket. Regexps to catch all are welcome, of
    course ;)

    More of Rob W. W. Hooft's spelling fixes. The only ones left now are the
    distutils patches, which I'll leave to the distutils maintainers.
    
    Tip: review the patch like this:
    
    grep "^[\!+-] " <patchfile>
    
    To get a quick and easy way to review the actual changes. Most of the
    changes are single-line ones, anyway.

    Rob W. W. Hooft's spelling fixes for the Library Reference. I hope
    SourceForge doesn't choke on this batch :-)
    
    I'm not entirely sure this is 100% correct. The patch changes an
    \index{persistency} to \index{presistence}, and I don't know what \index{}
    does. But it seems to do so persi--er, consistently, so I hope it isn't a
    problem.

    Fix to a bug found by Florian Weimer:
    
    The UTF-8 decoder is still buggy (i.e. it doesn't pass Markus Kuhn's
    stress test), mainly due to the following construct:
    
        #define UTF8_ERROR(details)  do {                       \
            if (utf8_decoding_error(&s, &p, errors, details))   \
                goto onError;                                   \
            continue;                                           \
        } while (0)
    
    (The "continue" statement is supposed to exit from the outer loop,
    but of course, it doesn't.  Indeed, this is a marvelous example of
    the dangers of the C programming language and especially of the C
    preprocessor.)

    Spelling fixes supplied by Rob W. W. Hooft. All these are fixes in either
    comments, docstrings or error messages. I fixed two minor things in
    test_winreg.py ("didn't" -> "Didn't" and "Didnt" -> "Didn't").
    
    There is a minor style issue involved: Guido seems to have preferred English
    grammar (behaviour, honour) in a couple places. This patch changes that to
    American, which is the more prominent style in the source. I prefer English
    myself, so if English is preferred, I'd be happy to supply a patch myself ;)

    debug_instance(): Use the same %p format directive as with
    debug_cycle(), and don't cast the pointer to a long.  Neither needs
    the literal `0x' prefix as %p automatically inserts this (on Linux at
    least).

    Fix bugs in readinst():
    * There was no error reported if the .read() method returns a non-string
    * If read() returned too much data, the buffer would be overflowed causing a
      core dump
    * Used strncpy, not memcpy, which seems incorrect if there are embedded \0s.
    * The args and bytes objects were leaked

    Patch #100854 from jhylton: eliminate compiler warnings in pyexpat:
            The first two warnings seem harmless enough,
            but the last one looks like a potential bug: an
            uninitialized int is returned on error. (I also
            ended up reformatting some of the code,
            because it was hard to read.)

    fix bug #42 reported by Andrew Dalke
    
    The Compare close contains a close method that checks to see if there
    is any unconsumed data in the Compare instance; i.e. if the canonical
    output file contains more data than was produced by the current test
    run. This method was never called, allowing differences to go
    undetected.
    
    Fix is to call close after the test is run (after __import__)
    
    output/test_long and output/test_popen2 needed trivial changes
    output/test_select contained lots of text, but test_select.py produced

    string_join(): Some cleaning up of reference counting.  In the
    seqlen==1 clause, before returning item, we need to DECREF seq.  In
    the res=PyString... failure clause, we need to goto finally to also
    decref seq (and the DECREF of res in finally is changed to a
    XDECREF).  Also, we need to DECREF seq just before the
    PyUnicode_Join() return.

    - changed hash calculation for unicode strings.  the new
      value is calculated from the character values, in a way
      that makes sure an 8-bit ASCII string and a unicode string
      with the same contents get the same hash value.
    
      (as a side effect, this also works for ISO Latin 1 strings).

    Give ConfigParser the capability to set as well as read options, and to write
    a representation of the configuration state in .ini format that can be read
    back in by a future read() call.  Thus this class is now a back end
    for .ini editors as well as parsers.
    
    This patch is complete and tested, but exposes a bug in the ConfigParser
    implementation which I have not yet fixed.  Because case information is
    discarded during parsing, the output of write() has its case smashed.
    
    I wrote this for a SourceForge interface script called forgetool.
    Documentation for the new entry points included.

    Patch from Joe Eaton <jeaton@hostway.net> (SF#100741) to fix following problem:
      There is a silly bug in the fall-back dumbdbm.py database package in
      the Python 1.5.2 standard distro. This bug causes any changes to an
      existing item to generate a new key, even when the key already
      exists.  After many updates, the .dir file used by dumbdbm grows to
      a huge size, and can cause filesystem problems.

    Better error handling of bad entity references.  Before when an & in

    one about a missing semicolon and one about an unknown entity.  Now
    you get only one about a bogus ampersand.

    - added popen.popen2/popen3/popen4 support for
      windows.
    
    - added optional mode argument to popen2/popen3
      for unix; if the second argument is an integer,
      it's assumed to be the buffer size.
    
    - changed nt.popen2/popen3/popen4 return values
      to match the popen2 module (stdout first, not
      stdin).

    - merged setlocale and set_locale.  the internal setlocale
      function is overridden by a python version which accepts
      *either* a string (old behaviour) or a locale tuple.
    
    - renamed a few methods (for consistency):
    
            get_locale => getlocale
            get_default_locale => getdefaultlocale
            set_to_default => resetlocale (!)
    
    - the _locale implementation module can now implement
      an optional _getdefaultlocale function.  if that function
      isn't available, a POSIX-based approach is used (checking
      LANG and other environment variables, as usual).

    - added (long) casts to a couple of Py_BuildValue calls,
      just for the sake of it.
    
      note that this only covers the unlikely case that size_t
      is smaller than a long; it's probably more likely that
      there are platforms out there where size_t is *larger*
      than a long, and mmapmodule cannot really deal with that
      today.

    Somebody started playing with const, so of course the outcome
    was cascades of warnings about mismatching const decls.  Overall,
    I think const creates lots of headaches and solves almost
    nothing.  Added enough consts to shut up the warnings, but
    this did require casting away const in one spot too (another
    usual outcome of starting down this path):  the function
    mymemreplace can't return const char*, but sometimes wants to
    return its first argument as-is, which latter must be declared
    const char* in order to avoid const warnings at mymemreplace's
    call sites.  So, in the case the function wants to return the
    first arg, that arg's declared constness must be subverted.

    staring at the diffs before checking this one in.  let me know
    asap if it breaks things on your platform.

    - this is a tentative checkin of the #100764 patch (by
      Barry Scott).  it appears to solve the problem on NT
      and 2000, but not on Windows 95.
    
      in other words, it's better than before, but not per-
      fect.  I'll leave the patch open for now.

    Cray J90 fixes for long ints.
    This was a convenient excuse to create the pyport.h file recently
    discussed!
    Please use new Py_ARITHMETIC_RIGHT_SHIFT when right-shifting a
    signed int and you *need* sign-extension.  This is #define'd in
    pyport.h, keying off new config symbol SIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT_ZERO_FILLS.
    If you're running on a platform that needs that symbol #define'd,
    the std tests never would have worked for you (in particular,
    at least test_long would have failed).
    The autoconfig stuff got added to Python after my Unix days, so
    I don't know how that works.  Would someone please look into doing
    & testing an auto-config of the SIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT_ZERO_FILLS
    symbol?  It needs to be defined if & only if, e.g., (-1) >> 3 is
    not -1.

    Got RID of redundant coercions in longobject.c (as spotted by Greg
    Stein -- thanks!).  Incidentally removed all the Py_PROTO macros
    from object.h, as they prevented my editor from magically finding
    the definitions of the "coercion", "cmpfunc" and "reprfunc"
    typedefs that were being redundantly applied in longobject.c.

Author: Marc-André Lemburg <mal@egenix.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 7 13:48:25 2000 +0000

    Fixed unicode() to use the new API PyUnicode_FromEncodedObject().
    This adds support for instance to the constructor (instances
    have to define __str__ and can return Unicode objects via that
    hook; string return values are decoded into Unicode using the
    current default encoding).

    Fix bug #392, reported by Jonathan Giddy <jon@dstc.edu.au>:
    In posixmodule.c:posix_fork, the function PyOS_AfterFork is called for
    both the parent and the child, despite the docs stating that it should
    be called in the new (child) process.
    
    This causes problems in the parent since the forking thread becomes the
    main thread according to the signal module.
    
    Calling PyOS_AfterFork() only in the child fixes this.  Changed for both
    fork() and forkpty().

Author: Marc-André Lemburg <mal@egenix.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 6 11:29:01 2000 +0000

    Added new codec APIs and a new interface method .encode() which
    works just like the Unicode one. The C APIs match the ones in the Unicode
    implementation, but were extended to be able to reuse the existing
    Unicode codecs for string purposes too.
    
    Conversions from string to Unicode and back are done using the
    default encoding.

    Added prototypes for the new codec APIs for strings. These APIs
    match the ones in the Unicode implementation, but were extended
    to be able to reuse the existing Unicode codecs for string
    purposes too.
    
    Conversion from string to Unicode and back are done using the

    Several small changes, mostly to the markup, to improve consistency and
    internal hyperlinking.  Move some things around, also for consistency
    with other modules ("See also" stuff tends to live at the \section level,
    before sub-sections, etc.).

    Add more "volatile" decls to stop gcc -Wall warnings.
    Somebody w/ gcc please check that the wngs are gone!
    There are cheaper (at runtime) ways to prevent the wngs, but
    they're obscure and delicate.  I'm going for the easy Big
    Hammer here under the theory that PCRE will be replaced by
    SRE anyway.

    Added new .isalpha() and .isalnum() methods to match the same
    ones on the Unicode objects. Note that the string versions use
    the (locale aware) C lib APIs isalpha() and isalnum().

    Added #defines to enable SUSv2 compatibility where available and
    to switch on support for BSD and SysV on platforms which use glibc
    such as Linux.
    
    These #defines are documented in e.g. the file /usr/include/features.h
    on Linux platforms and the SUSv2 docs.

    Wrapped some long lines.
    Cleaned up the table of error constants defined in pyexpat.errors; an
    extra pair of braces had pretty much destroyed the table!  (Not sure why.)
    Moved the pyexpat.errors module documentation into a \section with the
    proper headers for a module.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Tue Jul 4 23:51:31 2000 +0000

    pyexpat.errors is a *strange* module!
    
    It gets initialized when pyexpat is imported, and is only accessible as an
    attribute of pyexpat; it cannot be imported itself.  This allows it to at
    least be importable after pyexpat itself has been imported by adding it
    to sys.modules, so it is not quite as strange.
    
    This arrangement needs to be better thought out.

    Removed Py_PROTO and switched to ANSI C declarations in the dict
    implementation.  This was really to test whether my new CVS+SSH
    setup is more usable than the old one -- and turns out it is (for
    whatever reason, it was impossible to do a commit before that
    involved more than one directory).

    2 fixes plus one extension:
    - Actually count the linefeeds in a the CDATA content.
    - Don't call the endtag handler for an unmatched endtag (this makes
      the base class simpler since it doesn't have to deal with unopened
      endtags).
    - If the __init__ method is called with keyword argument
      translate_attribute_references=0, don't attempt to translate
      character and entity references in attribute values.

    Fixed symbol search for defining NSIG. It now also checks _NSIG
    which some C libs define (e.g. glibc).
    
    Added a fallback default value for NSIG which hopefully provides
    enough room for signal slots.

    libinstall:  For the first bytecode compilation pass, use -tt instead of
                 -t.  This ensures that each installation from source is
                 checked for compliance.  This is needed to make sure .py
                 files in the various Lib/plat-foo/ directories are tested
                 even if the core developers do not have access to the
                 corresponding platforms.

    - added lookbehind support (?<=pattern), (?<!pattern).
      the pattern must have a fixed width.
    
    - got rid of array-module dependencies; the match pro-
      gram is now stored inside the pattern object, rather
      than in an extra string buffer.
    
    - cleaned up a various of potential leaks, api abuses,
      and other minors in the engine module.
    
    - use mal's new isalnum macro, rather than my own work-
      around.
    
    - untabified test_sre.py.  seems like I removed a couple
      of trailing spaces in the process...

    which are true for alphabetic and alphanumeric characters resp.
    
    The macros are currently implemented using the existing is* tables

    If auto-conversion fails, the Unicode codecs will return NULL.
    This is now checked and the error passed on to the caller.

    Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>:
    This patch implements relative-path semantics for the "source" facility resembling
    those of cpp(1), documents the change, and improves the shlex test main to
    make it easier to test this feature.  Along the way, it fixes a name error
    in the existing docs.
    
    [Additional documentation markup changes for consistency by FLD.]

    cmpfiles():  Added shallow and use_statcache parameters, with same meanings
                 and defaults as for filecmp.cmp().  Updated docstring
                 accordingly, and formatted it more like others in the standard
                 library.

    The example_nt directory was old enough to vote.  Frank Stajano
    pointed out some of the problems he had following the instructions,
    and I stumbled into the others:  MSVC has changed in several
    respects, Python has changed the directories into which it builds
    its own Windows outputs, and we grew the unusual scheme of
    appending "_d" to the names of debug-mode output files.
    
    This should all work with VC6 + CVS Python now.  Some other Windows
    geek please confirm!  And the less you know, the better <0.5 wink>.
    
    Explanations and examples for versions of MSVC before 6, and
    versions of Python before 2.0b1, have been removed, because
    they're too different and so confuse life.  This last step I OK'ed
    with Guido first (indeed, 'twas his idea!).

    - experimental: added two new attributes to the match object:
      "lastgroup" is the name of the last matched capturing group,
      "lastindex" is the index of the same group.  if no group was
      matched, both attributes are set to None.
    
      the (?P#) feature will be removed in the next relase.

    Changes from Moshe:
    - distutils: Windows installers are already working
    
    - string methods: .join() seems to be the concensus, so it should probably
      be docommented
    
    - filecmp.py supersedes cmp, cmpcache and dircmp
    
    - winreg is completely new: _winreg is an adaptation of what used to be in
      win32api, and winreg is a Python implementation which adds OO syntax.
      Perhaps you know that, but the text is misleading.

    In b_setitem(), instead of the platform dependent CHAR_MIN and
    CHAR_MAX, use hardcoded -128 and 127.  This may seem strange, unless
    you realize that we're talking about signed bytes here!  Bytes are
    always 8 bits and 2's complement.  CHAR_MIN and CHAR_MAX are
    properties of the char data type, which is guaranteed to hold at least
    8 bits anyway.
    
    Otherwise you'd get failing tests on platforms where unsigned char is
    the default (e.g. AIX).
    
    Thanks, Vladimir Marangozov, for finding this nit!

    Simplify the registry-module-finding code: _winreg or win32api/win32con.
    This'll work fine with 2.0 or 1.5.2, but is less than ideal for
    1.6a1/a2.  But the code to accomodate 1.6a1/a2 was released with
    Distutils 0.9, so it can go away now.

    Trent Mick <trentm@activestate.com>:
    
    Fix PC/msvcrtmodule.c and PC/winreg.c for Win64. Basically:
    
    - sizeof(HKEY) > sizeof(long) on Win64, so use PyLong_FromVoidPtr()
    instead of PyInt_FromLong() to return HKEY values on Win64
    
    - Check for string overflow of an arbitrary registry value (I know
    that ensuring that a registry value does not overflow 2**31 characters
    seems ridiculous but it is *possible*).

    Trent Mick <trentm@activestate.com>:
    
    The common technique for printing out a pointer has been to cast to a long
    and use the "%lx" printf modifier. This is incorrect on Win64 where casting
    to a long truncates the pointer. The "%p" formatter should be used instead.
    
    The problem as stated by Tim:
    > Unfortunately, the C committee refused to define what %p conversion "looks
    > like" -- they explicitly allowed it to be implementation-defined. Older
    > versions of Microsoft C even stuck a colon in the middle of the address (in
    > the days of segment+offset addressing)!
    
    The result is that the hex value of a pointer will maybe/maybe not have a 0x
    prepended to it.
    
    
    Notes on the patch:
    
    There are two main classes of changes:
    - in the various repr() functions that print out pointers
    - debugging printf's in the various thread_*.h files (these are why the
    patch is large)
    
    
    Closes SourceForge patch #100505.

    Trent Mick <trentm@activestate.com>:
    
    This patch fixes possible overflow in the use of
    PyOS_GetLastModificationTime in getmtime.c and Python/import.c.
    
    Currently PyOS_GetLastModificationTime returns a C long. This can
    overflow on Win64 where sizeof(time_t) > sizeof(long). Besides it
    should logically return a time_t anyway (this patch changes this).
    
    As well, import.c uses PyOS_GetLastModificationTime for .pyc
    timestamping.  There has been recent discussion about the .pyc header
    format on python-dev.  This patch adds oveflow checking to import.c so
    that an exception will be raised if the modification time
    overflows. There are a few other minor 64-bit readiness changes made
    to the module as well:
    
    - size_t instead of int or long for function-local buffer and string
    length variables
    
    - one buffer overflow check was added (raises an exception on possible
    overflow, this overflow chance exists on 32-bit platforms as well), no
    other possible buffer overflows existed (from my analysis anyway)
    
    Closes SourceForge patch #100509.

    the mad patcher strikes again:
    
    -- added pickling support (only works if sre is imported)
    
    -- fixed wordsize problems in engine
       (instead of casting literals down to the character size,
       cast characters up to the literal size (same as the code
       word size).  this prevents false hits when you're matching
       a unicode pattern against an 8-bit string. (unfortunately,
       this broke another test, but I think the test should be
       changed in this case; more on that on python-dev)
    
    -- added sre.purge function
       (unofficial, clears the cache)

    Trent Mick <trentm@activestate.com>:
    This patch fixes possible overflows in the socket module for 64-bit
    platforms (mainly Win64). The changes are:
    
    - abstract the socket type to SOCKET_T (this is SOCKET on Windows, int
    on Un*x), this is necessary because sizeof(SOCKET) > sizeof(int) on
    Win64
    
    - use INVALID_SOCKET on Win32/64 for an error return value for
    accept()
    
    - ensure no overflow of the socket variable for: (1) a PyObject return
    value (use PyLong_FromLongLong if necessary); and (2) printf
    formatting in repr().
    
    Closes SourceForge patch #100516.

    still trying to figure out how to fix the remaining
    group reset problem.  in the meantime, I added some
    optimizations:
    
    - added "inline" directive to LOCAL
    
      (this assumes that AC_C_INLINE does what it's
      supposed to do).  to compile SRE on a non-unix
      platform that doesn't support inline, you have
      to add a "#define inline" somewhere...
    
    - added code to generate a SRE_OP_INFO primitive
    
    - added code to do fast prefix search
    
      (enabled by the USE_FAST_SEARCH define; default
      is on, in this release)

    On second thought, first try for _winreg, and then winreg.  Only if both

    This patch fixes a possible overflow in the Sleep system call on
    Win32/64 in the time_sleep() function in the time module. For very
    large values of the give time to sleep the number of milliseconds can
    overflow and give unexpected sleep intervals. THis patch raises an
    OverflowError if the value overflows.

    Trent Mick <trentm@activestate.com>:
    This patch fixes the posix module for large file support mainly on
    Win64, although some general cleanup is done as well.
    
    The changes are:
    
    - abstract stat->STAT, fstat->FSTAT, and struct stat->STRUCT_STAT
    This is because stat() etc. are not the correct functions to use on
    Win64 (nor maybe on other platforms?, if not then it is now trivial to
    select the appropriate one). On Win64 the appropriate system functions
    are _stati64(), etc.
    
    - add _pystat_fromstructstat(), it builds the return tuple for the
    fstat system call. This functionality was being duplicated. As well
    the construction of the tuple was modified to ensure no overflow of
    the time_t elements (sizeof(time_t) > sizeof(long) on Win64).
    
    - add overflow protection for the return values of posix_spawnv and
    posix_spawnve
    
    - use the proper 64-bit capable lseek() on Win64
    
    - use intptr_t instead of long where appropriate from Win32/64 blocks
    (sizeof(void*) > sizeof(long) on Win64)
    
    This closes SourceForge patch #100513.

    Mark Hammond provided (a long time ago) a better Win32 specific
    time_clock implementation in timemodule.c. The library for this
    implementation does not exist on Win64 (yet, at least). This patch
    makes Win64 fall back on the system's clock() function for
    time_clock().
    
    This closes SourceForge patch #100512.

    This patch extends PC/config.h and configure.in as appropriate for
    64-bit readiness (the config values are needed for patches that I will
    be submitting later today. The changes are as follows:
    
    - add SIZEOF_OFF_T #define's to PC/config.h (it was already in configure.in)
    
    - add SIZEOF_TIME_T #define to PC/config.h and configure
    Needed for some buffer overflow checking because sizeof(time_t) is
    different on Win64.
    
    - add SIZEOF_FPOS_T #define
    Needed for the Win64 large file support implementation.
    
    - add SIZEOF_HKEY in PC/config.h only
    Needed for proper Win32 vs. Win64 handling in PC/winreg.c
    
    - #define HAVE_LARGEFILE_SUPPORT for Win64
    
    - typedef long intptr_t; for all Windows except Win64 (which defines it
    itself)
    This is a new ANSI (I think) type that is useful (and used by me) for
    proper handling in msvcrtmodule.c and posixmodule.c
    
    - indent the nested #ifdef's and #defines in PC/config.h
    This is *so* much more readable. There cannot be a compiler
    compatibilty issue here can there? Perl uses indented #defines and it
    compiles with everything.

    This patch addresses two main issues: (1) There exist some non-fatal
    errors in some of the hash algorithms. For exmaple, in float_hash and
    complex_hash a certain part of the value is not included in the hash
    calculation. See Tim's, Guido's, and my discussion of this on
    python-dev in May under the title "fix float_hash and complex_hash for
    64-bit *nix"
    
    (2) The hash algorithms that use pointers (e.g. func_hash, code_hash)
    are universally not correct on Win64 (they assume that sizeof(long) ==
    sizeof(void*))
    
    As well, this patch significantly cleans up the hash code. It adds the
    two function _Py_HashDouble and _PyHash_VoidPtr that the various
    hashing routine are changed to use.
    
    These help maintain the hash function invariant: (a==b) =>
    (hash(a)==hash(b))) I have added Lib/test/test_hash.py and

    [Old patch that hadn't been checked in.]
    
    get_starttag_text():  New method.
            Return the text of the most recently parsed start tag, from
            the '<' to the '>' or '/'.  Not really useful for structure
            processing, but requested for Web-related use.  May also be
            useful for being able to re-generate the input from the parse
            events, but there's no equivalent for end tags.
    
    attrfind:  Be a little more forgiving of unquoted attribute values.

    - fixed another split problem
      (those semantics are weird...)
    
    - got rid of $Id$'s (for the moment, at least).  in other
      words, there should be no more "empty" checkins.
    
    - internal: some minor cleanups.

    - fixed split
      (test_sre still complains about split, but that's caused by
      the group reset bug, not split itself)
    
    - added more mark slots
      (should be dynamically allocated, but 100 is better than 32.
      and checking for the upper limit is better than overwriting
      the memory ;-)
    
    - internal: renamed the cursor helper class
    
    - internal: removed some bloat from sre_compile

    threads use --without-threads.  No extra tests of thread/compiler
    combinations have been added.
    
    --with(out)-thread and --with(out)-threads are completely
    interchangeable.
    
    --with-threads still supports the =DIRECTORY option for specifying
    where to find thread libraries.

    Fixed so 'get_source_files()' calls 'check_extension_list()' -- that way,

    even if we haven't built it yet.  Bug spotted by Harry Gebel.

    Fixed 'findall()' so it only returns regular files -- no directories.
    Changed 'prune_file_list()' so it also prunes out RCS and CVS directories.
    Added 'is_regex' parameter to 'select_pattern()', 'exclude_pattern()',
      and 'translate_pattern()', so that you don't have to be constrained
      by the simple shell-glob-like pattern language, and can escape into
      full-blown regexes when needed.  Currently this is only available
      in code -- it's not exposed in the manifest template mini-language.
    Added 'prune' option (controlled by --prune and --no-prune) to determine
      whether we call 'prune_file_list()' or not -- it's true by default.
    Fixed 'negative_opt' -- it was misnamed and not being seen by dist.py.
    Added --no-defaults to the option table, so it's seen by FancyGetopt.

    Vladimir Marangozov:
    
    This patch fixes a problem on AIX with the signed int case code in
    getargs.c, after Trent Mick's intervention about MIN/MAX overflow
    checks. The AIX compiler/optimizer generates bogus code with the
    default flags "-g -O" causing test_builtin to fail: int("10", 16) <>
    16L. Swapping the two checks in the signed int code makes the problem
    go away.
    
    Also, make the error messages fit in 80 char lines in the
    source.

    DECREF(inst).  This caused a segfault in PyDict_GetItem, called with a
    NULL dict, whenever inst->in_dict fails under low-memory conditions.

    Urmpf.  Quality control on this patch lapsed a bit. :-(
    
    The depth field was never decremented inside w_object(), and it was
    never initialized in PyMarshal_WriteObjectToFile().
    
    This caused imports from .pyc files to fil mysteriously when the .pyc
    file was written by the broken code -- w_object() would bail out
    early, but PyMarshal_WriteObjectToFile() doesn't check the error or
    return an error code, and apparently the marshalling code doesn't call
    PyErr_Check() either.  (That's a separate patch if I feel like it.)

    Running the program through itself reveals that one end tag was
    mislabeled.
    
    (Using -c and then -e rearranges some comments, so I won't check that
    in -- but it's a good test anyway.
    
    Note that pindent is not perfect -- e.g. it doesn't know about
    triple-quoted strings!)

    Peter Schneider-Kamp:
    
    Problem:
    A Python program can be completed and reformatted using
    Tools/scripts/pindent.py. Unfortunately there is no option for removal
    of the generated "# end"-tags.  Although a few Python commands or a
    "grep -v '# end '" can do wonders here, there are two drawbacks:
    - not everyone has grep/time to write a Python script
    - it is not checked whether the "# end"-tags were used validly
    
    Solution:
    add extra option "-e" (eliminate) to pindent.py

    Fix warnings on 64-bit build build of signalmodule.c
    
    - Though I know that SIG_DFL and SIG_IGN are just small constants,
    there are cast to function pointers so the appropriate Python call is
    PyLong_FromVoidPtr so that the pointer value cannot overflow on Win64
    where sizeof(long) < sizeof(void*).

    Trent Mick:
    
    This patch fixes cPickle.c for 64-bit platforms.
    
    - The false assumption sizeof(long) == size(void*) exists where
    PyInt_FromLong is used to represent a pointer. The safe Python call
    for this is PyLong_FromVoidPtr. (On platforms where the above
    assumption *is* true a PyInt is returned as before so there is no
    effective change.)
    
    - use size_t instead of int for some variables

    Trent Mick: use size_t instead of int where appropriate (in strxfrm(),
    to hold strlen() outcome).

    Trent Mick:
    
    This patches fixes a possible overflow of the optional timeout
    parameter for the select() function (selectmodule.c). This timeout is
    passed in as a double and then truncated to an int. If the double is
    sufficiently large you can get unexpected results as it
    overflows. This patch raises an overflow if the given select timeout
    overflows.
    
    [GvR: To my embarrassment, the original code was assuming an int could
    always hold a million.  Note that the overflow check doesn't test for
    a very large *negative* timeout passed in -- but who in the world
    would do such a thing?]

    Trent Mick:
    
    Various small fixes to the builtin module to ensure no buffer
    overflows.
    
    - chunk #1:
    Proper casting to ensure no truncation, and hence no surprises, in the
    comparison.
    
    - chunk #2:
    The id() function guarantees a unique return value for different
    objects.  It does this by returning the pointer to the object. By
    returning a PyInt, on Win64 (sizeof(long) < sizeof(void*)) the pointer
    is truncated and the guarantee may be proven false. The appropriate
    return function is PyLong_FromVoidPtr, this returns a PyLong if that
    is necessary to return the pointer without truncation.
    
    [GvR: note that this means that id() can now return a long on Win32
    platforms.  This *might* break some code...]
    
    - chunk #3:
    Ensure no overflow in raw_input(). Granted the user would have to pass
    in >2GB of data but it *is* a possible buffer overflow condition.

    Revise the description of when functions retrieved from class instances
    are and are not turned into bound methods; some confusion was noted by
    Andrew Dalke.
    
    In particular, it has to be noted that functions located on the class
    instance are not turned into any sort of method, only those which are
    found via the underlying class.

    Michael Hudson <mwh21@cam.ac.uk>:
    As I really do not have anything better to do at the moment, I have written
    a patch to Python/marshal.c that prevents Python dumping core when trying
    to marshal stack bustingly deep (or recursive) data structure.
    
    It just throws an exception; even slightly clever handling of recursive
    data is what pickle is for...
    
    [Fred Drake:]  Moved magic constant 5000 to a #define.
    
    This closes SourceForge patch #100645.

    Testing: test_array.py was also extended to check that one can set the

    array types.
    
    This closes SourceForge patch #100506.

commit 541dc3b7b2606906e0ee2d9088a984443b1fa64c
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 28 17:49:30 2000 +0000

    Trent Mick <trentm@activestate.com>:
    
    The cause: Relatively recent (last month) patches to getargs.c added
    overflow checking to the PyArg_Parse*() integral formatters thereby
    restricting 'b' to unsigned char value and 'h','i', and 'l' to signed
    integral values (i.e. if the incoming value is outside of the
    specified bounds you get an OverflowError, previous it silently
    overflowed).
    
    The problem: This broke the array module (as Fredrik pointed out)
    because *its* formatters relied on the loose allowance of signed and
    unsigned ranges being able to pass through PyArg_Parse*()'s
    formatters.
    
    The fix: This patch fixes the array module to work with the more
    strict bounds checking now in PyArg_Parse*().
    
    How: If the type signature of a formatter in the arraymodule exactly
    matches one in PyArg_Parse*(), then use that directly. If there is no
    equivalent type signature in PyArg_Parse*() (e.g. there is no unsigned
    int formatter in PyArg_Parse*()), then use the next one up and do some
    extra bounds checking in the array module.
    
    This partially closes SourceForge patch #100506.

    Thomas Wouters <thomas@xs4all.net>:
    
    This patch adds the openpty() and forkpty() library calls to posixmodule.c,
    when they are available on the target
    system. (glibc-2.1-based Linux systems, FreeBSD and BSDI at least, probably
    the other BSD-based systems as well.)
    
    Lib/pty.py is also rewritten to use openpty when available, but falls
    back to the old SGI method or the "manual" BSD open-a-pty
    code. Openpty() is necessary to use the Unix98 ptys under Linux 2.2,
    or when using non-standard tty names under (at least) BSDI, which is
    why I needed it, myself ;-) forkpty() is included for symmetry.

    Define the 'executables' class attribute so the CCompiler constructor
    doesn't blow up.  We don't currently use the 'set_executables()' bureaucracy,
    although it would be nice to do so for consistency with UnixCCompiler.

    Fixed the "pre-link hook" so it actually works, mainly by renaming it
    to 'msvc_prelink_hack()', adding the parameters that it actually needs,
    and only calling it for MSVC compiler objects.  Generally gave up on the
    idea of a general "hook" mechanism: deleted the empty 'precompile_hook()'.

    Call 'customize_compiler()' after getting CCompiler object.

commit bb7baa793dc8dbfa00ee6253dd61c35457736fb8
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Jun 25 02:09:14 2000 +0000

    Added the 'customize_compiler()' function, which plugs in the essential
    information about building Python extensions that we discovered in
    Python's makefile.  Currently only needed on Unix, so does nothing on
    other systems.

commit e5c62bf6e872730388265932ca042ae7df0684f2
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Jun 25 02:08:18 2000 +0000

    Introduced some bureaucracy for setting and tracking the executables
    that a particular compiler system depends on.  This consists of the
    'set_executables()' and 'set_executable()' methods, and a few lines in
    the constructor that expect implementation classes to provide an
    'executables' attribute, which we use to initialize several instance
    attributes.  The default implementation is somewhat biased in favour of
    a Unix/DOS "command-line" view of the world, but it shouldn't be too
    hard to override this for operating systems with a more sophisticated
    way of representing programs-to-execute.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Jun 25 02:05:29 2000 +0000

    Got rid of direct dependence on the sysconfig module.  Mainly, this
    meant playing along with the new "dictionary of executables" scheme
    added to CCompiler by adding the 'executables' class attribute, and
    changing all the compile/link/etc. methods to use the new attributes
    (which encapsulate both the program to run and its standard arguments,
    so it was a *little* bit more than just changing some names).

    Added 'split_quoted()' function to deal with strings that are quoted in
    Unix shell-like syntax (eg. in Python's Makefile, for one thing -- now that
    I have this function, I'll probably allow quoted strings in config files too.

    Changed the default installation directory for data files (used by

    sys.prefix.  (Any setup scripts out there that specify data files will have
    to set the installation directory, relative to the base, explicitly.)

    Changed so all the help-generating functions are defined, at module-level,
    in the module of the command classes that have command-specific
    help options.  This lets us keep the principle of lazily importing
    the ccompiler module, and also gets away from defining non-methods
    at class level.

    This patch modifies the type structures of objects that
    participate in GC.  The object's tp_basicsize is increased when
    GC is enabled.  GC information is prefixed to the object to
    maintain binary compatibility.  GC objects also define the
    tp_flag Py_TPFLAGS_GC.

    Patch from Lorenzo M. Catucci:
    I discovered the [MREMAP_MAYMOVE] symbol is only defined when _GNU_SOURCE is
    defined; therefore, here is the change: if we are compiling for linux,
    define _GNU_SOURCE before including mman.h, and all is done.

    Patch from /F:
    this patch adds a fast _flatten function to the _tkinter
    module, and imports it from Tkinter.py (if available).
    
    this speeds up canvas operations like create_line and
    create_polygon.  for example, a create_line with 5000
    vertices runs about 50 times faster with this patch in
    place.

    Patch from Trent Mick:
            The seek() method is broken for any 'whence' value (seek from
            start, current, orend) other than the default. I have a patch
            that fixes that as well as gets mmap'd files working on
            Linux64 and Win64.

    Pulled the MSVC++-specific hackery out to a new method, 'prelink_hook()',
    and added (empty) 'precompile_hook()' for symmetry.  One can envision
    a much more elaborate hook mechanism, but this looks like it'll do for
    now.

    size of the mapped area.  This seems to be what the Windows version does.
    This change requires keeping around the fd of the mapped file.

    Changed 'remove_tree()' to use the new 'grok_environment_error()' function
    instead of muddling through IOError and OSError exception objects itself.

    Added 'grok_environment_error()' function to deal with the various
    forms that IOError and OSError can take (taken from core.py).

    Bastian Kleineidam: added 'remove_tree()' function.  Needed so that
    'remove_tree()' can cooperate with 'mkpath()' in the maintenance of
    the PATH_CREATED cache: specifically, if a directory is created
    with 'mkpath()', later removed with 'remove_tree()', and 'mkpath()'
    is again requested to create it, then it would erroneously think
    the directory already existed, because it was in the PATH_CREATED
    cache.  The patch (slightly tweaked by me) fixes that.

    Thomas Wouters <thomas@xs4all.net>:
    The following patch adds "sq_contains" support to rangeobject, and enables
    the already-written support for sq_contains in listobject and tupleobject.
    
    The rangeobject "contains" code should be a bit more efficient than the
    current default "in" implementation ;-) It might not get used much, but it's
    not that much to add.
    
    listobject.c and tupleobject.c already had code for sq_contains, and the
    proper struct member was set, but the PyType structure was not extended to
    include tp_flags, so the object-specific code was not getting called (Go
    ahead, test it ;-). I also did this for the immutable_list_type in
    listobject.c, eventhough it is probably never used. Symmetry and all that.

    Updated to the fix in %c formatting: it now always checks for
    a one character argument.

    Marc-Andre Lemburg <mal@lemburg.com>:
    Added emulations of the C APIs in _locale to be used when the
    _locale module is not enabled. They return the correct values
    assuming the 'C' locale.

    Harry Henry Gebel: fix '_format_changelog()' so it doesn't bomb if
    passed None.

commit 14c8d05a7a72b814431b193aabf246760753d6ac

Date:   Thu Jun 8 01:22:48 2000 +0000

    Include setup.cfg in the list of default files to distribute.

commit ce15c6ce8dac7a7aa25eed6033ce1b459b312aab
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Thu Jun 8 01:06:02 2000 +0000

    Moved the code that prunes the file list after reading the manifest
      template into a new method 'prune_file_list()', called from
      'get_file_list()' rather than 'read_manifest()' -- this keeps
      'read_manifest()' more general.
    Deleted the redundant call to 'exclude_pattern()' in 'make_distribution()'
      -- this had the same intention as 'prune_file_list()', but was incomplete
      (only pruned the release tree, not the build tree) and in the wrong
      place (the prune wouldn't be reflected in the manifest file).

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Thu Jun 8 00:52:52 2000 +0000

    Renamed 'find_defaults()' to 'add_defaults()'.
    Deleted old, commented-out 'exclude_pattern()' method.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>

commit f8b9e20d943030fbcab182a7a48a74e0c9aaf509
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Thu Jun 8 00:08:14 2000 +0000

    Made all debug output go through the 'debug_print()' method instead of
    directly printing to stdout.  This was a bit more work than it sounds like
    it should have been:
      * turned 'select_pattern()' and 'exclude_pattern()' from functions into
        methods, so they can refer to 'self' to access the method
      * commented out the *other* 'exclude_pattern()' method, which appears
        to be vestigial code that was never cleaned up when the
        'exclude_pattern()' function was created
      * changed the one use of the old 'exclude_pattern()' method to use the
        new 'exclude_pattern()' (same behaviour, slightly different args)
      * some code and docstring reformatting
      * and, of course, changed all the debugging prints to 'debug_print()' calls
    Added/tweaked some regular ('self.announce()') output for better runtime
      feedback.

    Moved AE module to the core toolbox set: it is needed by Nav and it isn't all _that_ huge.
    Modified for new builtin exceptions.c.

    Marc-Andre Lemburg <mal@lemburg.com>:
    Changed the API names for setting the default encoding.
    These are now in line with the other hooks API names
    (no underscores).

commit 90e81471181e4afa841505b6fe81b379b64001de
Author: Marc-André Lemburg <mal@egenix.com>
Date:   Wed Jun 7 09:13:21 2000 +0000

    Marc-Andre Lemburg <mal@lemburg.com>:
    Change the default encoding to 'ascii' (it was previously
    defined as UTF-8).
    
    Note: The implementation still uses UTF-8 to implement
    the buffer protocol, so C APIs will still see UTF-8. This
    is on purpose: rather than fixing the Unicode implementation,
    the C APIs should be made Unicode aware.

    Added some more codec aliases. Some of them are needed by the

Author: Marc-André Lemburg <mal@egenix.com>
Date:   Wed Jun 7 09:12:09 2000 +0000

    Marc-Andre Lemburg <mal@lemburg.com>:
    Added support to set the default encoding of strings
    at startup time to the values defined by the C locale.
    
    The sys.setdefaultencoding() API is deleted after having
    set up the encoding, so that user code cannot subsequentely
    change the setting. This effectively means that only site.py
    may alter the default setting.

    Marc-Andre Lemburg <mal@lemburg.com>:

    locale encodings, a feature which is used by the new default
    encoding support in site.py.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Jun 7 03:00:06 2000 +0000

    Patch from Rene Liebscher: this adds "--help-foo" options to list the
    values that "--foo" can take for various commands: eg. what formats for
    "sdist" and "bdist", what compilers for "build_ext" and "build_clib".
    
    I have *not* reviewed this patch; I'm checking it in as-is because it also
    fixes a paper-bag-over-head bug in bdist.py, and because I won't have
    time to review it properly for several days: so someone else can
    test it for me, instead!

    Always look for the system config file in the Distutils module directory,
    and call it "distutils.cfg" instead of "pydistutils.cfg" (personal
    config files are still ".pydistutils.cfg" or "pydistutils.cfg", though).

    Patch from Rene Liebscher:
    Look for personal config file in /home/greg on Windows, too: users will have
    to set /home/greg to use this, so it's not something that many people will
    use.  But if python-dev comes up with the "right way" to divine a
    home directory on Windows, we can use that to set /home/greg and poof! --
    personal Distutils config files on Windows.

commit 28a5f44cca9c5f6abe319f3a446bf057d66e980e
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Tue Jun 6 02:57:07 2000 +0000

    First crack at the Distutils "config" command.  Unlike other commands, this
    one doesn't *do* anything by default; it's just there as a conduit for data
    (eg. include dirs, libraries) from the user to the "build" commands.
    However, it provides a couple of Autoconf-ish methods ('try_compile()',
    'try_link()', 'try_run()') that derived, per-distribution "config" commands
    can use to poke around the target system and see what's available.
    
    Initial experimenst with mxDateTime indicate that higher-level methods are
    necessary: analogs of Autoconf's AC_CHECK_HEADER, AC_CHECK_LIB will be
    needed too (and that's just to probe the C/C++ system: how to probe the
    Python system is wide open, and someday we'll have to worry about probing a
    Java system too).

    Half-fixed RPM 2 compatibility:added 'rpm_base' option, which must be set

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Jun 4 15:00:34 2000 +0000

    Patch from Harry Henry Gebel:
    Fills in question marks in help
    
    Reads scripts in from files rather than strings
    
    Adds RPM 2 compatibility mode (untested). Use of this mode requires that
    --bdist-base be specified because bdist_rpm has no way of detecting where
    RPM wants to find spec files and source files. An unmodified RedHat 5.0
    system would require '--bdist-base=/usr/src/RedHat'. (You would also have
    to be root.) If the rpmrc file has been modified to allow RPMs to be built
    by normal users then --build-base would need to be changed accordingly.
    
    Formats the changelog.
    
    GPW: tweaked formatting, added some editorial comments.

    First version of the project that produces a working Carbon binary. The binary has only been tested on MacOS9, so far. This project needs CW IDE 4.1b4 or later.

commit 2b44ba5203a45c54caec57695e20ef6cc4c870a2
Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 21:38:19 2000 +0000

    Revived various of the compatability routines and made them Carbon-compliant. This is needed because the initial carbon-python does not use GUSI.

commit a04b24bf8d7dfd881176427e1140a410e2df6d41
Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 21:36:39 2000 +0000

    Removed hfsrunning() macro. This means MacPython won't run on MacOS 5 (oops, System 5) or earlier anymore:-)

commit e79dc76f53dfa18fb08c35f71b049259642c0142
Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 21:35:07 2000 +0000

    Made the core toolbox modules carbon-compatible using the new greylist feature of bgen: non-carbon methods are still included in non-carbon MacPython. The issue of backward compatibility of Python code is still open.
    Macmodule and macosmodule have also been carbonified. Some functionality is still missing there.

commit 33d1ad28cba273b94c70ffc22deb6c53b0c1b068
Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 21:29:59 2000 +0000

    Replaced GetFInfo and SetFInfo calls with FspGetFInfo and FspSetFInfo calls, which are carbon-compatible.

commit ee6eeb1876d2764e505a30122f273b644bf63ec1
Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 21:28:52 2000 +0000

    Removed (within an #ifdef) Carbon-incompatabilities:
    - Don't call all the toolbox init routines.
    - No balloon help, so removed help code from the initial dialog.

commit bb6d83a8c4b5d6872b7bf5ee927a184f286cf56d
Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 21:27:11 2000 +0000

    Removed (within an #ifdef) Carbon-incompatabilities:
    - Use TickCount() in stead of LMGetTicks()
    - Don't use xxxGetFile event filter
    - Don't call SystemTask or HandleSysWindowEvent (is this also automatically handled under os9??)
    - Don't scan event queue for cmd-. (to be fixed at some point).

Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 21:23:09 2000 +0000

    Fixed callback function arguments to be carbon-compatible.
    (Temporarily?) removed call to ProcessHighLevelEvent until we find out how to do this (Carbon only).

    Bumped version number to 0.9pre (there will be a couple of code snapshots
    before the real release, but I want to make it clear that a major new
    release is on the way).

    Use Distribution method 'dump_option_dicts()' for debugging output, and only
    do so if DEBUG is true.

commit 673925842eef8faf8f3dc1c01b3e22288bcbf475
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 01:52:04 2000 +0000

    Ditched the obsolete '_get_package_data()' method and its
    '_check_*()' helpers.

commit 1259392b38402448a05460c77d242132e22fe695
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Jun 2 01:49:58 2000 +0000

    Fairly massive overhaul to support getting RPM inputs (extra meta-data,
    prep/build/etc. scripts, doc files, dependency info) from a config file
    rather than the dedicated "package_info" file.  (The idea is that
    developers will provide RPM-specific info in the "[bdist_rpm]" section of
    setup.cfg, but of course it could also be supplied in the other config
    files, on the command line, or in the setup script -- or any mix of the
    above.)
    
    Major changes:
      * added a boatload of options to 'user_options' and
        'initialize_options()': 'distribution_name', 'group', 'release', ...
      * added 'finalize_package_data()', which takes the place of
        '_get_package_data()' -- except it's called from 'finalize_options()',
        not 'run()', so we have everything figured out before we actually run
        the command
      * added 'ensure_string()', 'ensure_string_list()', 'ensure_filename()';
        these take the place of '_check_string()' and friends.  (These actually
        look like really useful type-checking methods that could come in handy
        all over the Distutils; should consider moving them up to Command and
        using them in other command classes' 'finalize_options()' method for
        error-checking).
      * various cleanup, commentary, and adaptation to the new way of
        storing RPM info in '_make_spec_file()'

    Trent Mick <trentm@ActiveState.com>:
    This patch correct bounds checking in PyLong_FromLongLong. Currently, it does
    not check properly for negative values when checking to see if the incoming
    value fits in a long or unsigned long. This results in possible silent
    truncation of the value for very large negative values.

    More tweaking to make this command act like other Distutils commands:
      * added "--bdist-base" option to parameterize where we build
        the RPM (comes from "bdist" by default: "build/bdist.<plat>")
      * simplified/cleaned up some code in 'run()' in the process of
        removing (most) hard-coded directory names
      * if "--spec-only", drop spec file in "dist" rather than "redhat"
        (directory name still hard-coded, though)
      * use 'reinitialize_command()' to fetch the "sdist" object to
        tweak before running "sdist" command
      * use 'self.copy_file()' method rather than 'copy_file()' function
      * cosmetic tweaks to comments, error messages

    Regularize options a bit:
      * help strings start with lowercase
      * added affirmative version of '--no-clean' and '--no-rpm-opt-flags',
        which are the default (thus the attributes that correspond to
        the options are now 'clean' and 'use_rpm_opt_flags')

    Import the new Extension class, so setup scripts can
    "from distutils.core import" it.

commit 5322f008c5d3728fbcec3fd5abb6561cecea0567
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed May 31 01:09:52 2000 +0000

    Overhauled to expect 'self.extensions' (taken from 'ext_modules' in the
    setup script) to be a list of Extension instances, rather than a list of of
    (ext_name, build_info) tuples.  This is mostly a simplification, but
    'check_extension_list()' got a lot more complicated because of the need to
    convert the old-style tuples to Extension instances.
    
    Temporarily dropped support for defining/undefining macros in the
    'extensions' list -- I want to change the interface, but haven't yet made
    the required changes in CCompiler and friends to support this nicely.
    
    Also neatened up the code that merges 'extra_compile_flags' and the CFLAGS
    environment variable.

    Provides the Extension class, a nicer way to describe C/C++ extensions than
    the old (ext_name, build_info) tuple.

    Moved the CCompiler exceptions here, to avoid having to import ccompiler.py
      just to get a little exception class.
    No more string-based exceptions.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>

    Added 'dump_options()' for debugging output.

commit c32d9a69527af6d2823650ea7674e207c975f090
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun May 28 23:53:06 2000 +0000

    Factored '_set_command_options()' out of 'get_command_obj()'.
    Added 'reinitialize_command()' -- lets us "push" option values in
      a controlled, safe way; this is a small change to the code, but
      a big change to the Distutils philosophy of passing option values
      around.  The preferred mode is still definitely to "pull" options
      from another command (eg. "install" fetches the base build directory
      from "build"), but it is now feasible to "push" options onto another
      command, when you know what's best for it.  One possible application
      will be a "config" command, which pokes around the system and pushes
      values (eg. include and library directories) onto the "build" command.
    Added 'dump_option_dicts()' method (for debugging output).

    Some far-reaching naming changes:
      * Command method 'find_peer()' -> 'get_finalized_command()'
      * Command method 'run_peer()' -> 'run_command()'
    Also deleted the 'get_command_option()' method from Command, and
      fixed the one place where it was used (in "bdist_dumb").

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sat May 27 03:03:23 2000 +0000

    Patch from Andrew Kuchling: prune out the build and source distribution
    directories after all is said and done, so we don't accidentally include
    those files in the source distribution.
    
    (This is the quick and easy way to fix this; Andrew says: "Changing
    findall() looked like it was going to be messy, so I tried this instead.
    The only problem is that redundant directory traversals are being done,
    walking through build/ only to throw out all the files found at the end.").

    Support for the "install_headers" command: distribution option 'headers'
    and method 'has_headers()'.

    'mkpath()' now detects non-string 'name' arguments -- this is a fairly common
    bug when adding new code, so I thought I'd make it blow up earlier
    than deep in posix.py.

    Support for the "install_headers" command:
      * 'headers' entry added to all the install schemes
      * '--install-headers' option added
      * 'install_headers' added to 'sub_commands'
      * added 'dist_name' to configuration variables (along with a few
        others that seem handy: 'dist_version', 'dist_fullname', and
        'py_version'
      * in 'finalize_unix()', make sure 'install_headers' defined if
        user specified 'install_base' and/or 'install_platbase'
      * added 'has_headers()'
      * a few other small changes

    Patch from M.-A. Lemburg:
    Python on UNIX now trusts PYTHONHOME unconditionally
    
    Modules/getpath.c:
    
    Landmark changed to os.py.
    
    Setting PYTHONHOME now unconditionally sets sys.prefix
    (and sys.exec_prefix). No further checks are done whether the
    standard lib can be found in that location or not. This is in
    sync with the PC subdir getpath implementations.
    
    PC/getpathp.c:
    
    Landmark changed to os.py.
    
    PC/os2vacpp/getpathp.c:
    
    Landmark changed to os.py.
    
    Note: BAW's checkin on exceptions.c eliminates earlier concerns about
    a bogus PYTHONHOME value leading to a core dump.  Instead it causes a
    useless sys.path and prevents imports.

    Added documentation for gettempprefix().
    Deprecated direct access to template.
    Added note about past need to modify template so that legacy code has a
    better chance of being understood, noting that the requirement to reset
    template after os.fork() disappeared in 1.5.2.

    When building on Solaris and the compiler is GCC, use '$(CC) -G' to
    create shared extensions rather than 'ld -G'.  This ensures that shared
    extensions link against libgcc.a, in case there are any functions in the
    GCC runtime not already in the Python core.

    Factored out code for extracting-or-creating one of the option
      dictionaries in 'self.command_options' to 'get_option_dict()'.
    Simplified code in 'parse_config_files()' and 'parse_command_line()'
      accordingly.
    Fixed code in constructor that processes the 'options' dictionary
      from the setup script so it actually works: uses the new
      'self.command_options' dictionary rather than creating command
      objects and calling 'set_option()' on them.

    Fixed a couple of long-hidden bugs (amazing what you find when you
    attempt to verify the bold assertions in the documentation):
      * entries for the "root package" in 'package_dir' didn't work --
        fixed by improving the fall-through code in 'get_package_dir()'
      * __init__.py files weren't installed when modules-in-packages
        were listed individually (ie. in 'py_modules' in the setup script);
        fixed by making 'check_package()' return the name of the __init__
        file if it exists, and making 'find_modules()' add an entry to
        the module list for __init__ if applicable

    All the exception building related stuff has been moved out of this
    module and into _exceptions.c.  This includes all the PyExc_* globals,
    the bltin_exc table, init_class_exc(), fini_instances(),
    finierrors().
    
    Renamed _PyBuiltin_Init_1() to _PyBuiltin_Init() since the two phase
    initializations are necessary any more.
    
    Removed as obsolete _PyBuiltin_Init_2(), _PyBuiltin_Fini_1() and
    _PyBuiltin_Fini_2().

    Py_Initialize(): Now that standard exceptions are builtin, we don't
    need two phase init or fini of the builtin module.  Change the call of
    _PyBuiltin_Init_1() to _PyBuiltin_Init().  Add a call to
    init_exceptions().
    
    Py_Finalize(): Don't call _PyBuiltin_Fini_1().  Instead call
    fini_exceptions() but move this to before the thread state is
    cleared.

    Improvements to Bastian's build_scripts command:
      * 'first_line_re' loosened up
      * command description improved
      * replaced '_copy_files()' and '_adjust_files()' with one method
        that does everything, 'copy_scripts()' -- this should be more
        efficient than Bastian's version, should behave better in
        dry-run mode, and does timestamp dependency-checking

    Bastian Kleineidam: the "build_scripts" command.

commit 8d5881a2ba7a7ed83f26ed55dbde2ef4753556da
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Thu May 25 01:19:18 2000 +0000

    Bastian Kleineidam: the "build_scripts" command and changes
    necessary to support it.
    
    Details:
      - build command additionally calls build_scripts
      - build_scripts builds your scripts in 'build/scripts' and adjusts the
        first line if it begins with "#!" and ends with "python", optionally
        ending with commandline options (like -O, -t ...).  Adjusting means we
        write the current path to the Python interpreter in the first line.
      - install_scripts copies the scripts to the install_scripts dir
      - install_data copies your data_files in install_data. You can
        supply individual directories for your data_files:
    
        data_files = ['doc/info.txt', # copy this file in install_scripts dir
          ('testdata', ['a.dat', 'b.dat']), # copy these files in
                                            # install_scripts/testdata
          ('/etc', ['packagerc']),    # copy this in /etc. When --root is
                                      # given, copy this in rootdir/etc
        ]
    
        So you can use the --root option with absolute data paths.

    Fix a problem reported by Oleg Broytmann, who complains that very
    often, ftp URLs hang in the final close.  Further analysis suggests
    that this is because the close hook in addclosehook() calls the hook
    before acually closing the connection.  The hook, in this case, waits
    for the '226 Transfer complete' status from the server on the command
    socket.  However, more and more ftp servers only send this status when
    the data socket has actually been closed -- causing a deadlock.
    
    The fix is simple: in addclosehook.close(), call addbase.close()
    *before* calling the closehook.

    Note: two very large tables (of key names, and of character names) were

      * some typos fixed
      * kludged 'parse_config_files()' to re-initialize the ConfigParser
        instance after each file, so we know for sure which config
        file each option comes form
      * added lots of handy debugging output

Date:   Tue May 23 01:44:20 2000 +0000

    OptionDummy now has a constructor that takes a list of options: each string
    in the option list is an attribute of the OptionDummy that will be
    initialized to None.

    Tweaked usage message.

commit d5d8a9982b77ef54fcacf8ff7bfa449a2eab35db
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Tue May 23 01:42:17 2000 +0000

    Marching towards full support of config files: thoroughly overhauled the
    command-line parsing code, splitting it up into several methods (new
    methods: '_parse_command_opts()', '_show_help()') and making it put options
    into the 'command_options' dictionary rather than instantiating command
    objects and putting them there.
    
    Lots of other little changes:
      * merged 'find_command_class()' and 'create_command_obj()' and
        called the result 'get_command_class()'
      * renamed 'find_command_obj()' to 'get_command_obj()', and added
        command object creation and maintenance of the command object cache to
        its responsibilities (taken over from 'create_command_obj()')
      * parse config files one-at-a-time, so we can keep track of the
        filename for later error reporting
      * tweaked some help messages
      * fixed up many obsolete comments and docstrings

    Changed list_directory() somewhat.  It is now only called when there
    is no index.htm[l] file, and when it is called, it also spits out the
    headers.  When an index.htm[l] file is present, the regular (file
    access) path is followed.  Also, when the guessed content-type matches
    text/*, open the file in text mode; otherwise in binary mode.

    Tweaked output of 'copy_file()': if copying to a new name, show the whole
    destination path, otherwise show just the directory.

    Changed the semantics of the 'sub_commands' list: instead of function
      objects, it now has method names.
    Added three methods, 'has_lib()', 'has_scripts()', and 'has_data()'
      to determine if we need to run each of the three possible sub-commands.
    Added 'get_sub_commands()' to take care of finding the methods named
      in 'sub_commands', running them, and interpreting the results to
      build a list of sub-commands that actually have to be run.

    Added support for the 'export_symbols' parameter to 'link_shared_object()'
    and 'link_shared_lib()'.  In MSVCCompiler, this is meaningful: it adds
    /EXPORT: options to the linker command line.  In UnixCCompiler, it
    is ignored.

    Contribution from Harry Henry Gebel: the 'bdist_rpm' command.
    
    (Completely uninspected and untested by me, this is just to

    In 'install_misc': 'self.outfiles' defaults to the empty list, so we don't
    have to worry about "or []" in 'get_outputs()'.

    Added 'get_inputs()' methods, needed by the "install" command's
    'get_inputs()'.

Date:   Sat May 13 03:06:56 2000 +0000

    Drastically simplified by taking advantage of the "install" command's
    new flexibility, specifically the 'root' option.  Now, we just use
    "install" to do a fake installation into a temporary directory
    (the 'bdist_dir' option, which derives from the 'bdist_base' option of
    "bdist"), and then tar/zip up that directory.  This means that dumb
    built distributions are now relative to the root directory, rather than
    the prefix or exec-prefix; this is probably a feature, but does make
    them slightly less flexible.

    file to write the list of installed files to.

    Ditch the explicit search for *.py[co] files -- they're now included in
    the list returned by 'get_outputs()', thanks to changes in the
    "install_lib" command.

    Added '_bytecode_filenames()' method, and use it in 'get_outputs()'
    to ensure that compiled bytecode files are considered part of the output
    of the "install_lib" command.

    Added the 'build_bdist' option and code to clean it up -- this is the
    top-level temporary directory for creating built distributions.  (Won't
    work yet, since the "build" command doesn't yet have a 'build_bdist'
    option, and none of the "bdist" commands support it yet.)

    Patch from Bastien Kleineidam:
    adds the 'install_data' and 'install_scripts' commands; these two
    are trivial thanks to the 'install_misc' base class in cmd.py.
    (Minor tweaks and commentary by me; the code is untested so far.)

    Fix from Lyle Johnson: add the '--compiler' option.
    Also added creation of 'implib_dir', a temporary directory specific to

      because I'm not sure which is right.

    The addition of rint() (by Peter Schneider-Kamp; I forgot to mention

    Trent Mick:
    
    Use "win32" for sys.platform on Win64 instead of "win32" because:
    1. While it may be confusing to the Python scriptor on Win64 that he has to
       check for win*32*, that is something that he will learn the first time. It
       is better than the alternative of the scriptor happily using "win64" and
       then that code not running on Win32 for no good reason.
    2. The main question is: is Win64 so much more like Win32 than different from
       it that the common-case general Python programmer should not ever have to
       make the differentiation in his Python code. Or, at least, enough so that
       such differentiation by the Python scriptor is rare enough that some other
       provided mechanism is sufficient (even preferable). Currently the answer
       is yes. Hopefully MS will not change this answer.

    Limit the 'b' formatter of PyArg_ParseTuple to valid values of an unsigned
    char, i.e. [0,UCHAR_MAX]. It is expected that this is the common usage of 'b'.
    An OverflowError is raised if the parsed value is outside this range.

    M.-A. Lemburg <mal@lemburg.com>:

    current implementation uses a per-process global which
    defines the value of the encoding parameter in case it
    is set to NULL (meaning: use the default encoding).

    New version from Jim Fulton to fix a problem that Eric Raymond ran
    into.  Jim writes:
    
    The core dump was due to a C decrement operation
    in a macro invocation in load_pop.  (BAD)
    
    I fixed this by moving the decrement outside
    the macro call.
    
    I added a comment to load_pop and load_mark
    to document the fact that cPickle separates the
    unpickling stack into two separate stacks, one for
    objects and one for marks.
    
    I also moved some increments out of some macro
    calls (PyTuple_SET_ITEM and PyList_SET_ITEM).
    This wasn't necessary, but made me feel better. :)
    
    I tested these changes in *my* cPickle, which
    doesn't have the new Unicode stuff.

    Fix the string methods that implement slice-like semantics with
    optional args (count, find, endswith, etc.) to properly handle
    indeces outside [INT_MIN, INT_MAX]. Previously the "i" formatter
    for PyArg_ParseTuple was used to get the indices. These could overflow.
    
    This patch changes the string methods to use the "O&" formatter with
    the slice_index() function from ceval.c which is used to do the same
    job for Python code slices (e.g. 'abcabcabc'[0:1000000000L]).

    Trent Mick:
    
    Fix overflow bug in ldexp(x, exp). The 'exp' argument maps to a C int for the
    math library call [double ldexp(double, int)], however the 'd'
    PyArg_ParseTuple formatter was used to yield a double, which was subsequently
    cast to an int. This could overflow.
    
    [GvR: mysteriously, on Solaris 2.7, ldexp(1, 2147483647) returns Inf
    while ldexp(1, 2147483646) raises OverflowError; this seems a bug in
    the math library (it also takes a real long time to compute the
    Inf outcome).  Does this point to a bug in the CHECK() macro?  It
    should have discovered that the result was outside the HUGE_VAL range.]

    Changes to PC\config.[hc] for Win64. MSVC defines _WINxx to differentiate the
    various windows platforms. Python's MS_WINxx are keyed off of these. Note
    that _WIN32 (and hence MS_WIN32 in Python) are defined on Win32 *and* on
    Win64. This is for compatibility reasons. The idea is that the common case is
    that code specific to Win32 will also work on Win64 rather than being
    specific to Win32 (i.e. there is more the same than different in WIn32 and
    Win64).
    
    The following modules are specifically excluded in the Win64 build:

    The patch to config.h looks big but it really is not. These are the effective
    changes:
    - MS_WINxx are keyed off _WINxx
    - SIZEOF_VOID_P is set to 8 for Win64
    - COMPILER string is changed appropriately for Win64

    Changes the 'b', 'h', and 'i' formatters in PyArg_ParseTuple to raise an
    Overflow exception if they overflow (previously they just silently
    overflowed).
    
    Changes by Guido: always accept values [0..255] (in addition to
    [CHAR_MIN..CHAR_MAX]) for 'b' format; changed some spaces into tabs in
    other code.

    The methods islower(), isupper(), isspace(), isdigit() and istitle()
    gave bogus results for chars in the range 128-255, because their
    implementation was using signed characters.  Fixed this by using
    unsigned character pointers (as opposed to using Py_CHARMASK()).

    Alas, Vladimir's patch was too aggressive, and started causing really
    weird errors.  (E.g. see thread "weird bug in test_winreg" in python-dev.)
    
    Since it's actually useful to be able to re-run an individual test
    after running test.autotest, we keep the unloading code, but only for
    modules whose full name starts with "test.".

    Fast NonRecursiveMutex support by Yakov Markovitch, markovitch@iso.ru,
    who wrote:
    
    Here's the new version of thread_nt.h.  More particular, there is a
    new version of thread lock that uses kernel object (e.g. semaphore)
    only in case of contention; in other case it simply uses interlocked
    functions, which are faster by the order of magnitude.  It doesn't
    make much difference without threads present, but as soon as thread
    machinery initialised and (mostly) the interpreter global lock is on,
    difference becomes tremendous.  I've included a small script, which
    initialises threads and launches pystone.  With original thread_nt.h,
    Pystone results with initialised threads are twofold worse then w/o
    threads.  With the new version, only 10% worse.  I have used this
    patch for about 6 months (with threaded and non-threaded
    applications).  It works remarkably well (though I'd desperately
    prefer Python was free-threaded; I hope, it will soon).

Date:   Thu May 4 15:55:17 2000 +0000

    When the UTF-8 conversion to Unicode fails, return an 8-bit string
    instead.  This seems more robust than returning an Unicode string with
    some unconverted charcters in it.
    
    This still doesn't support getting truly binary data out of Tcl, since
    we look for the trailing null byte; but the old (pre-Unicode) code did
    this too, so apparently there's no need.  (Plus, I really don't feel
    like finding out how Tcl deals with this in each version.)

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu May 4 15:07:16 2000 +0000

    Two changes to improve (I hope) Unicode support.
    
    1. In Tcl 8.2 and later, use Tcl_NewUnicodeObj() when passing a Python
    Unicode object rather than going through UTF-8.  (This function
    doesn't exist in Tcl 8.1, so there the original UTF-8 code is still
    used; in Tcl 8.0 there is no support for Unicode.)  This assumes that
    Tcl_UniChar is the same thing as Py_UNICODE; a run-time error is
    issued if this is not the case.
    
    2. In Tcl 8.1 and later (i.e., whenever Tcl supports Unicode), when a
    string returned from Tcl contains bytes with the top bit set, we
    assume it is encoded in UTF-8, and decode it into a Unicode string
    object.
    
    Notes:
    
    - Passing Unicode strings to Tcl 8.0 does not do the right thing; this
    isn't worth fixing.
    
    - When passing an 8-bit string to Tcl 8.1 or later that has bytes with
    the top bit set, Tcl tries to interpret it as UTF-8; it seems to fall
    back on Latin-1 for non-UTF-8 bytes.  I'm not sure what to do about
    this besides telling the user to disambiguate such strings by
    converting them to Unicode (forcing the user to be explicit about the
    encoding).
    
    - Obviously it won't be possible to get binary data out of Tk this
    way.  Do we need that ability?  How to do it?

    (This is not exactly what Vladimir posted to the patches list; I've

    problem that only occurs in debug mode.  I'm also holding back on his

      this doesn't actually work.
    - Remove comment about fallback to string exceptions.
    - Remove a PyErr_Occurred() check after all is said and done that can
      never trigger.
    - Remove static function newstdexception() which is no longer called.

    Mark Hammond to the rescue:
    
    Checkin 2.131 of posixmodule.c changed os.stat on Windows, so that
    "/bin/" type notation (trailing backslash) would work on Windows to
    be consistent with Unix.
    
    However, the patch broke the simple case of: os.stat("\\")
    
    This did work in 1.5.2, and obviously should!
    
    This patch addresses this, and restores the correct behaviour.

    patches from Mark Hammond
    
    Attached is a set of diffs for the .py compiler that adds support
    for the new extended call syntax.
    
    compiler/ast.py:
    CallFunc node gets 2 new children to support extended call syntax -
    "star_args" (for "*args") and "dstar_args" (for "**args")
    
    compiler/pyassem.py
    It appear that self.lnotab is supposed to be responsible for
    tracking line numbers, but self.firstlineno was still hanging
    around.  Removed self.firstlineno completely.  NOTE - I didnt
    actually test that the generated code has the correct line numbers!!
    
    Stack depth tracking appeared a little broken - the checks never
    made it beyond the "self.patterns" check - thus, the custom methods
    were never called!  Fixed this.
    
    (XXX Jeremy notes: I think this code is still broken because it
    doesn't track stack effects across block bounaries.)
    
    Added support for the new extended call syntax opcodes for depth
    calculations.
    
    compiler/pycodegen.py
    
    Added support for the new extended call syntax opcodes.
    
    compiler/transformer.py
    
    Added support for the new extended call syntax.

    _PyBuiltin_Init_2(): Remove the misleading comment.

commit 47eeb9bdadbddb9d0d83c33415164eff10756bc4
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Tue May 2 19:24:06 2000 +0000

    initerrors(): Remove this function.  String-based standard exceptions
    are no longer supported (i.e. -X option is removed).
    
    _PyBuiltin_Init_1(): Don't call initerrors().  This does mean that it
    is possible to raise an ImportError before that exception has been
    initialized, say because exceptions.py can't be found, or contains
    bogosity.  See changes to errors.c for how this is handled.
    
    _PyBuiltin_Init_2(): Don't test Py_UseClassExceptionsFlag, just go
    ahead and initialize the class-based standard exceptions.  If this
    fails, we throw a Py_FatalError.

    usage_mid: Remove the description of the -X flag; it's gone now.
    
    Py_Main(): Remove the 'X' case.

    Py_UseClassExceptionsFlag is deprecated.  We keep the C variable for C
    API consistency, but nothing sets it or checks it now.

    I know this is only a temporary stop-gap measure, but the match() and
    search() functions didn't even work because _fixflags() isn't
    idempotent.  I'm adding another stop-gap measure so that you can at
    least use sre.search() and sre.match() with a zero flags arg.

    Marc-Andre Lemburg:
    
    Changed all references to the MAGIC constant to use a global
    pyc_magic instead. This global is initially set to MAGIC, but can be
    changed by the _PyImport_Init() function to provide for
    special features implemented in the compiler which are settable
    using command line switches and affect the way PYC files are
    generated.
    
    Currently this change is only done for the -U flag.

    (1) Added and documented the capability for shlex to handle
    lexical-level inclusion and a stack of input sources.  Also, the input
    stream member is now documented, and the constructor takes an optional

    [Conversion from 'U' to 'u' by Fred, based on python-dev comments.]

    This patch is a workaround for Macintosh, where the GUSI I/O library
    (time, stat, etc) use the MacOS epoch of 1-Jan-1904 and the MSL C
    library (ctime, localtime, etc) uses the (apparently ANSI standard)
    epoch of 1-Jan-1900. Python programs see the MacOS epoch and we
    convert values when needed.

    potentially useless optimization
    
    The previous checkin (2.84) added a PyErr_Format call that made the
    cost of raising an AttributeError much more expensive.  In general
    this doesn't matter, except that checks for __init__ and
    __del__ methods, where exceptions are caught and cleared in C, also
    got much more expensive.
    
    The fix is to split instance_getattr1 into two calls:
    
    instance_getattr2 checks the instance and the class for the attribute
    and returns it or returns NULL on error.  It does not raise an
    exception.
    
    instance_getattr1 does rexec checks, then calls instance_getattr2.  It
    raises an exception if instance_getattr2 returns NULL.
    
    PyInstance_New and instance_dealloc now call instance_getattr2
    directly.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>

    Hacked things up a bit so that configuration variables are expanded
    in command-line options, and in two phases at that: first, we expand
    'install_base' and 'install_platbase', and then the other 'install_*'
    options.  This lets us do tricky stuff like
        install --prefix='/tmp$sys_prefix'
    ...oooh, neat.
    
    Simplified 'select_scheme()' -- it's no longer responsible for expanding
    config vars, tildes, etc.
    
    Define installation-specific config vars in 'self.config_vars', rather than
    in a local dictionary of one method.  Also factored '_expand_attrs()' out
    of 'expand_dirs()' and added 'expand_basedirs()'.
    
    Added a bunch of debugging output so I (and others) can judge the
    success of this crazy scheme through direct feedback.

    Harry Henry Gebel:
    Adds bztar format to generate .tar.bz2 tarballs
    
    Uses the -f argument to overright old tarballs automatically, I am
    assuming that if the old tarball was wanted it would have been moved or
    else the version number would have been changed.
    
    Uses the -9 argument to bzip2 and gzip to use maximum
    compression. Compress uses the maximum compression by default.
    
    Tests for correct value for the 'compress' argument of make_tarball. This
    is one less place for someone adding new compression programs to forget to
    change.

    Christian Tismer -- total rewrite on trashcan code.
    
    Improvements:
    - does no longer need any extra memory
    - has no relationship to tstate
    - works in debug mode
    - can easily be modified for free threading (hi Greg:)
    
    Side effects:
    Trashcan does change the order of object destruction.
    Prevending that would be quite an immense effort, as
    my attempts have shown. This version works always
    the same, with debug mode or not. The slightly
    changed destruction order should therefore be no problem.
    
    Algorithm:
    While the old idea of delaying the destruction of some
    obejcts at a certain recursion level was kept, we now
    no longer aloocate an object to hold these objects.
    The delayed objects are instead chained together
    via their ob_type field. The type is encoded via
    ob_refcnt. When it comes to the destruction of the
    chain of waiting objects, the topmost object is popped
    off the chain and revived with type and refcount 1,
    then it gets a normal Py_DECREF.
    
    I am confident that this solution is near optimum
    for minimizing side effects and code bloat.

    Jack Jansen: The GUSI 2.0 I/O library used on the Mac uses the
    socklen_t (unsigned int) for most size parameters.  Apparently this is
    part of the UNIX 98 standard.
    
    [GvR: the changes to configure.in etc. that I just checked in make
    sure that socklen_t is defined everywhere, so I deleted the little
    part of Jack's mod to define socklen_t if not in GUSI2.  I suppose I
    will have to add it to the Windows config.h in a minute.]

    Mark Hammond:
    
    * Base address for all extension modules updated. PC\dllbase_nt.txt
    also updated.  Erroneous "libpath" directory removed for all
    projects.
    
    * winsound module moved from a builtin module to an extension
    module.  This was done primarily to avoid Python16.dll needing to
    pull in winmm.dll.  Really dumb test added for winsound - but if
    nothing else it ensures the module imports.

    * Temp directory for all projects are now specific to the project
    (rather than common as before).  This avoids any conflicts with
    debug symbols or common file names etc.
    NOTE: You should manually delete your existing build directory after
    applying this patch, as the MSVC "clean" command will now only clean
    the new temporary directories - not the existing common temp
    directory.
    
    * Base address for all extension modules updated. PC\dllbase_nt.txt
    also updated.  Erroneous "libpath" directory removed for all
    projects.
    
    * winsound module moved from a builtin module to an extension
    module.  This was done primarily to avoid Python16.dll needing to
    pull in winmm.dll.  Really dumb test added for winsound - but if
    nothing else it ensures the module imports.

    Patch by Charles G Waldman to avoid a sneaky memory leak in
    _PyTuple_Resize().  In addition, a change suggested by Jeremy Hylton
    to limit the size of the free lists is also merged into this patch.
    
    Charles wrote initially:
    
    """
    Test Case:  run the following code:
    
    class Nothing:
        def __len__(self):
            return 5
        def __getitem__(self, i):
            if i < 3:
                return i
            else:
                raise IndexError, i
    
    def g(a,*b,**c):
        return
    
    for x in xrange(1000000):
        g(*Nothing())
    
    
    and watch Python's memory use go up and up.
    
    
    Diagnosis:
    
    The analysis begins with the call to PySequence_Tuple at line 1641 in
    ceval.c - the argument to g is seen to be a sequence but not a tuple,
    so it needs to be converted from an abstract sequence to a concrete
    tuple.  PySequence_Tuple starts off by creating a new tuple of length
    5 (line 1122 in abstract.c).  Then at line 1149, since only 3 elements
    were assigned, _PyTuple_Resize is called to make the 5-tuple into a
    3-tuple.  When we're all done the 3-tuple is decrefed, but rather than
    being freed it is placed on the free_tuples cache.
    
    The basic problem is that the 3-tuples are being added to the cache
    but never picked up again, since _PyTuple_Resize doesn't make use of
    the free_tuples cache.  If you are resizing a 5-tuple to a 3-tuple and
    there is already a 3-tuple in free_tuples[3], instead of using this
    tuple, _PyTuple_Resize will realloc the 5-tuple to a 3-tuple.  It
    would more efficient to use the existing 3-tuple and cache the
    5-tuple.
    
    By making _PyTuple_Resize aware of the free_tuples (just as
    PyTuple_New), we not only save a few calls to realloc, but also
    prevent this misbehavior whereby tuples are being added to the
    free_tuples list but never properly "recycled".
    """
    
    And later:
    
    """
    This patch replaces my submission of Sun, 16 Apr and addresses Jeremy
    Hylton's suggestions that we also limit the size of the free tuple
    list.  I chose 2000 as the maximum number of tuples of any particular
    size to save.
    
    There was also a problem with the previous version of this patch
    causing a core dump if Python was built with Py_TRACE_REFS.  This is
    fixed in the below version of the patch, which uses tupledealloc
    instead of _Py_Dealloc.

    Use an explicit macro SOCKETCLOSE which expands to closesocket (on

    Hopefully this fixes a new compilation error that I suddenly get on

    apparently was done before including io.h, which contains a prototype
    for close.  (No idea why this wasn't an error before.)

    Patch by Brian Hooper, somewhat augmented by GvR, to strip a trailing
    backslash from the pathname argument to stat() on Windows -- while on
    Unix, stat("/bin/") succeeds and does the same thing as stat("/bin"),
    on Windows, stat("\\windows\\") fails while stat("\\windows") succeeds.
    This modified version of the patch recognizes both / and \.
    
    (This is odd behavior of the MS C library, since
    os.listdir("\\windows\\") succeeds!)

    Patch, originally from Bastian Kleineidam and savagely mutilated by me,
    to add the "display metadata" options: --name, --version, --author,
    and so forth.  Main changes:
      * added 'display_options' class attribute to list all the "display only"
        options (--help-commands plus the metadata options)
      * added DistributionMetadata class as a place to put the actual
        metadata information from the setup script (not to be confused with
        the metadata display options); the logic dealing with metadata
        (eg. return self.name or "UNKNOWN") is now  in this class
      * changed 'parse_command_line()' to use the new OO interface provided
        by fancy_getopt, mainly so we can get at the original order of
        options on the command line, so we can print multiple lines of
        distribution meta-data in the order specified by the user
      * added 'handle_display_options()' to handle display-only options
    Also fixed some crufty old comments/docstrings.

    in particular the original order of options seen on the command line.
    But it's a big improvement and should make it a lot easier to add

        either DistutilsSetupError or ValueError as appropriate
      - simplified a bunch of option get/set methods in Command and
        Distribution classes -- just pass on AttributeError most of

    ihooks.ModuleLoader does not implement reload(mod) correctly:
    If mod has already been loaded by ModuleLoader, it has
    been returned from a cache. Added an additional parameter
    to import_it() to force reloading.

    When refering to Unicode characters in exception messages and
    docstrings, the documentation guidelines call for "Unicode", not
    "unicode".  Comply.

    a missing part of the previous checkin message:
    
    Marc-Andre Lemburg:

    Marc-Andre Lemburg:
    
    Changed PyUnicode_Splitlines() maxsplit argument to keepends.
    The maxsplit functionality was replaced by the keepends
    functionality which allows keeping the line end markers together
    with the string.

    The maxsplit functionality in .splitlines() was replaced by the keepends
    functionality which allows keeping the line end markers together
    with the string.
    
    Added support for '%r' % obj: this inserts repr(obj) rather
    than str(obj).

    Marc-Andre Lemburg:

    Unicode object as first argument, return the object as-is.
    Raises an exception when given a Unicode object *and* an
    encoding name.

    I've had complaints about the comparison "where >= 0" before -- on
    IRIX, it doesn't even compile.  Added a cast: "where >= (char *)0".

    Yet another markup nit:  functions that are part of the Python/C API

    The reference count field for PyErr_NoMemory() and

    Christian Tismer: added test to ensure that multiplication commutes.
    
    [The test is in a slightly odd place, in test_division_2; but it
    exercises the recent change to long_mult(), and that's all we really
    ask for.  --GvR]

    Simple optimization by Christian Tismer, who gives credit to Lenny
    Kneler for reporting this issue: long_mult() is faster when the
    smaller argument is on the left.  Swap the arguments accordingly.

    Implement suggestion from Lawrence Kesteloot in PR#280, to change the
    default list of files from () to None, and explicitly test for None
    before defaulting to sys.argv[1:].  This means that if you pass in an
    explicit empty list, it will read stdin instead of defaulting to
    sys.argv[1:].  This fixes a buglet in the test script (when called
    with options but without files, it chokes when it tries to interpret
    the options as files).
    
    Lawrence adds: "I suspect that this is a safe change, because I can't
    imagine someone actively passing in an empty list when they want
    sys.argv used."
    
    I agree.

    Patch by Vladimir Marangozov to include the function name when

    Use a constant to specify the number of child threads to create.
    
    Instead of assuming that the number process ids of the threads is the
    same as the process id of the controlling process, use a copy of the
    dictionary and check for changes in the process ids of the threads
    from the thread's process ids in the parent process.  This makes the
    test make more sense on systems which assign a new pid to each thread
    (i.e., Linux).
    
    This doesn't fix the other problems evident with this test on Linux.

    Marc-Andre Lemburg:
    
    * '...%s...' % u"abc" now coerces to Unicode just like
      string methods. Care is taken not to reevaluate already formatted
      arguments -- only the first Unicode object appearing in the
      argument mapping is looked up twice. Added test cases for
      this to test_unicode.py.

commit 45ad3c48977110e1097efcf6332407deaf575c2e

    * More test cases for test_contains.py.

commit fd4b957b06b1b835e492fad3845d9ba12edb700e
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Apr 10 13:51:10 2000 +0000

    Marc-Andre Lemburg:
    
    * New exported API PyUnicode_Resize()
    
    * The experimental Keep-Alive optimization was turned back
      on after some tweaks to the implementation. It should now
      work without causing core dumps... this has yet to tested
      though (switching it off is easy: see the unicodeobject.c
      file for details).
    
    * Fixed a memory leak in the Unicode freelist cleanup code.
    
    * Added tests to correctly process the return code from
      _PyUnicode_Resize().
    
    * Fixed a bug in the 'ignore' error handling routines
      of some builtin codecs. Added test cases for these to
      test_unicode.py.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Apr 10 13:47:21 2000 +0000

    Marc-Andre Lemburg:
    
    * string_contains now calls PyUnicode_Contains() only when the other
      operand is a Unicode string (not whenever it's not a string).
    
    * New format style '%r' inserts repr(arg) instead of str(arg).
    
    * '...%s...' % u"abc" now coerces to Unicode just like
      string methods. Care is taken not to reevaluate already formatted
      arguments -- only the first Unicode object appearing in the
      argument mapping is looked up twice. Added test cases for
      this to test_unicode.py.

    Marc-Andre Lemburg:
    
    * TypeErrors during comparing of mixed type arguments including
      a Unicode object are now masked (just like they are for all
      other combinations).

    In line with a similar checkin to object.c a while ago, this patch
    gives a more descriptive error message for an attribute error on a

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Mon Apr 10 01:30:44 2000 +0000

    Added a check for the 'force' attribute in '__getattr__()' -- better than
      crashing when self.force not defined.
    Revise 'copy_file()' and 'copy_tree()' docstrings accordingly.
    Remove 'hasattr()' check for 'self.force' from 'make_file()'.

Date:   Mon Apr 10 00:19:42 2000 +0000

    Added '--force' option -- very clear what it means for building (ignore
    timestamps), so every build_* command has 'self.force', which follows the
    'build' command if not set by the user.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Mon Apr 10 00:18:16 2000 +0000

    Removed global '--force' option -- just too vague a concept to be applicable
    to all commands in the same way.  Several Command methods now either expect
    'self.force' to be defined, or check if it is defined and assume it's
    false if not.

    Ditched the unused 'list_only' option.
    Added code to include source files from 'build_clib' command to default file

    Started on GUSI2 and threading support. cfm68k targets are still included in all projects, but for the time being all the "fat" targets exclude them, making them basically copy operations. This way we don't have to rename everything, and anyone interested can easily try to fix 68k support.

    Marc-Andre's third try at this bulk patch seems to work (except that
    his copy of test_contains.py seems to be broken -- the lines he
    deleted were already absent).  Checkin messages:
    
    
    New Unicode support for int(), float(), complex() and long().
    
    - new APIs PyInt_FromUnicode() and PyLong_FromUnicode()
    - added support for Unicode to PyFloat_FromString()
    - new encoding API PyUnicode_EncodeDecimal() which converts
      Unicode to a decimal char* string (used in the above new
      APIs)
    - shortcuts for calls like int(<int object>) and float(<float obj>)
    - tests for all of the above
    
    Unicode compares and contains checks:
    - comparing Unicode and non-string types now works; TypeErrors
      are masked, all other errors such as ValueError during
      Unicode coercion are passed through (note that PyUnicode_Compare
      does not implement the masking -- PyObject_Compare does this)
    - contains now works for non-string types too; TypeErrors are
      masked and 0 returned; all other errors are passed through
    
    Better testing support for the standard codecs.
    
    Misc minor enhancements, such as an alias dbcs for the mbcs codec.
    
    Changes:
    - PyLong_FromString() now applies the same error checks as
      does PyInt_FromString(): trailing garbage is reported
      as error and not longer silently ignored. The only characters
      which may be trailing the digits are 'L' and 'l' -- these
      are still silently ignored.
    - string.ato?() now directly interface to int(), long() and
      float(). The error strings are now a little different, but
      the type still remains the same. These functions are now
      ready to get declared obsolete ;-)
    - PyNumber_Int() now also does a check for embedded NULL chars
      in the input string; PyNumber_Long() already did this (and
      still does)
    
    Followed by:
    
    Looks like I've gone a step too far there... (and test_contains.py
    seem to have a bug too).
    
    I've changed back to reporting all errors in PyUnicode_Contains()
    and added a few more test cases to test_contains.py (plus corrected
    the join() NameError).

    Lots of cleanup things.

    selection dialog.
    
    Got rid of references to backup etc. inserted by the installer wizard
    -- we don't use these.
    
    Got rid of conditionals for Windows 3.1, ditto.
    
    Changed version to 1.6a2.
    
    Changed default install directory to "C:\Python16" (not really, but close).
    
    Install only one copy of python16.lib.
    
    Install the two MS DLLs (versioned) and python16.dll (unversioned) in
    the system directory.
    
    Install Tcl/Tk and expat in the DLLs directory.

    Patch by Fred Gansevles.
    
    This patch solves 2 problems of the os module.
    1) Bug ID #50 (case-mismatch wiht "environ.get(..,..)" and "del environ[..]")
    2) os.environ.update (dict) doesn't propagate changes to the 'real'
       environment (i.e doesn't call putenv)
    
    This patches also has minor changes specific for 1.6a
    The string module isn't used anymore, instead the strings own methods are
    used.

Date:   Tue Apr 4 18:17:35 2000 +0000

    Patch from Hrvoje Niksic <hniksic@iskon.hr>:
    
    The bug is in mmap_read_line_method(), and its loop that searches for
    newlines.  After the loop reaches EOF, eol is incremented and points
    after the end of the memory.  This results in readline() method
    sometimes picking up and returning a byte after the end of the string.
    This is usually a bogus \0, but it could cause SIGSEGV if it's after
    the end of the page).
    
    The patch fixes the problem.  Also, it uses memchr() for finding a
    character, which is in fact the "strnchr" the comment is asking for.
    memchr() is already used in Python sources, so there should be no
    portability problems.

    Since Thomas Wouters kept complaining that he wants access to the the
    Unix From lines, change the UnixMailbox class so that _search_start()
    positions the file *before* the Unix From line instead of after it;
    change _search_end() to skip one line before looking for the next From
    line.  The rfc822.Message class automatically recognizes these Unix
    From lines and squirrels them away in the 'unixfrom' instance variable.

    Reorganization: ripped util.py to shreds, creating in the process:
      - file_util.py: operations on single files
      - dir_util.py: operations on whole directories or directory trees
      - dep_util.py: simple timestamp-based dependency analysis
      - archive_util.py: creation of archive (tar, zip, ...) files
    The functions left in util.py are miscellany that don't fit in any of the
    new files.

    Reorganization: moved the Distribution class from core.py to dist.py, and
    the Command class from core.py to cmd.py.  No other code needs changing
    though; distutils.core still provides the Command and Distribution classes,
    although indirectly now.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 19:51:06 2000 +0000

    Two more names.  I just realize that there may be more contributors to
    distutils lurking in CVS logs that I probably haven't read.  Oh well.

commit 5964f8d60b4f61f298b482d37646b0ad97b7ad53
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 19:45:17 2000 +0000

    I believe I've now got all the names mentioned in the CVS logs since
    1.5.2 was released, except those who contributed only to Doc files --
    Fred has his own way of doing this.
    
    This doesn't mean that I've got everyone who contributed *before*
    1.5.2 was released in here... :-(

commit 19ce16665dedb0fd16e2ce4ab33d4ca9af01faa9
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 19:04:25 2000 +0000

    Fixed my simplification to Thomas' patch: winreg and win32api export the same
    functions, but with different names.

Date:   Fri Mar 31 17:26:12 2000 +0000

    Marc-Andre Lemburg: The large unicode database table is broken in
    pages of 4k entries each. This should fix compiler problems on some
    platforms.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 17:25:23 2000 +0000

    Marc-Andre Lemburg: Error reporting in the codec registry and lookup
    mechanism is enhanced to be more informative.

Author: Andrew M. Kuchling <amk@amk.ca>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 17:24:30 2000 +0000

    Add '#include <netinet/tcp.h>'
    "man tcp" on Solaris says that TCP_NODELAY is defined in
    netinet/tcp.h, and the Open Groups Unix98 spec agrees
    (http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009619199/ninettcp.htm).

    This module's name should be linuxaudio*dev*.c

commit 1027e3fde9b9cb6eb470cc13e48fbd2208658b32
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 16:53:42 2000 +0000

    Simplified Thomas Heller's registry patch: just assign all those
    HKEY_* and Reg* names once, rather than having near-duplicate code
    in the two import attempts.
    
    Also dropped the leading underscore on all the imported symbols,
    as it's not appropriate (they're not local to this module).

    Added test case for pyexpat module that tries to exercise all the handlers

commit b7f105371f05d16a2d724d3662c98550d311bdfb
Author: Andrew M. Kuchling <amk@amk.ca>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 15:43:31 2000 +0000

    Added Python interface to Expat XML parser.
        The Setup.in entry is sort of a lie; it links with -lexpat, but
        Expat's Makefile doesn't actually build a libexpat.a.  I'll send
        Expat's author a patch to do that; if he doesn't accept it, this
        rule will have to list Expat's object files (ick!), or have a
        comment explaining how to build a .a file.

Date:   Fri Mar 31 14:59:30 2000 +0000

    Adding Fredrik Lundh's _sre.c module and its header files.

commit b4c850c928eb2783f8345b1c642e153f4cd3aed9
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 05:22:47 2000 +0000

    Added code to blow away the pseudo-installation tree and a 'keep_tree'
    option to disable this (by default, it's false and we clean up).

commit e5796fecc62935513ec2053540f741d0b8cb0920
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 05:21:27 2000 +0000

    Oops, got a little too enthusiastic deleting code in that last revision:
    we still have to *run* the sub-command that creates a built distribution.

commit 1889de8889422a05f96501d9cc18d453866b175c
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 05:20:27 2000 +0000

    Fixed 'make_archive()' to explicitly turn of compression when format is "tar".

commit 02296cea3999a33baf292b5fa54698d3b34320e0
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 05:08:50 2000 +0000

    Rename 'formats' option to 'format', and remove the ability to generate
    multiple built distributions in one run -- it seemed a bit dodgy and I'd
    rather remove it than try to beat it into submission right now.

commit 6b213766d8ded8021ae775e48ff46ae06d7bc11c
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 04:53:41 2000 +0000

    Import from 'types' module.
    Added 'ztar', 'tar' to 'format_command' dictionary.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 04:40:25 2000 +0000

    Tweaked 'get_platform()' to include the first character of the OS release:
    eg. sunos5, linux2, irix5.

commit 7d51034eefbadd7574f906ca3748ac0a42298544
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 04:37:40 2000 +0000

    Removed some old test code: don't set 'plat' when calling 'new_compiler()'.

commit 95c0b269de14f56a5b5d8fd0b57871b373b4b100
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 03:52:16 2000 +0000

    Don't perpetrate the "_d" hack for naming debugging extensions -- that's
    now done in the 'build_ext' command.

commit 842296480e80873de5f5042da42533044a9586dd
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 03:50:23 2000 +0000

    Patch (mostly) from Thomas Heller for building on Windows:
      * build to "Debug" or "Release" temp directory
      * put linker turds (.lib and .exp files) in the build temp directory
      * tack on "_d" to extensions built with debugging
      * added 'get_ext_libname()' help in putting linker turds to temp dir
    Also, moved the code that simplifies None to empty list for a bunch
      of options to 'finalize_options()' instead of 'run()'.

commit 6e8ee5d8e990d355fab602ab489ca43a7ae94aa5
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 03:34:09 2000 +0000

    Don't put Python's library directory into the library search path -- that's
    specific to building Python extensions.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 03:29:39 2000 +0000

    Add back an obscure "feature" to the Obj version of Tkapp_Call(): a
    None in an argument list *terminates* the argument list: further
    arguments are *ignored*.  This isn't kosher, but too much code relies
    on it, implicitly.  For example, IDLE was pretty broken.

    A version of FixTk.py that works with the way the installer now
    installs Tcl/Tk.

commit 1b64a7e4a54b41ab2ebfb942bb5bc2c04deb16f9
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 03:05:18 2000 +0000

    Added 'get_name()' and 'get_full_name()' methods to Distribution.
    Simplified 'Command.get_peer_option()' a tad -- just call 'find_peer()'
      to get the peer command object.
    Updated 'Command.copy_file()' to take a 'link' parameter, just like
      'util.copy_file()' does now.
    Added 'Command.make_archive()' to wrap 'util.make_archive()'.

commit 32ce329ce4c8ac8a958a624f060274bd50a8f5b9
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 03:02:22 2000 +0000

    Added 'create_tree()'.
    Changes to 'copy_file()':
      * added support for making hard links and symlinks
      * noted that it silently clobbers existing files when copying, but
        blows up if destination exists when linking -- hmmm...
      * error message tweak
    Added 'base_name' parameter to 'make_tarball()' and 'make_zipfile()'.
    Added 'make_archive()' -- wrapper around 'make_tarball()' or
      'make_zipfile()' to take care of the archive "root directory".

commit 318a9d7aa2163031eac19291592b1f396e11a879
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 02:57:31 2000 +0000

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 02:56:34 2000 +0000

    The 'bdist_dumb' command, the first worker bee for use by 'bdist'.  This is
    the command that actually creates "dumb" binary distributions, ie.
    tarballs and zip files that you just unpack under <prefix> or <exec-prefix>.
    Very limited, but it's a start.

commit 0f77f9569cffd512201089f086e230c789d09929
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 02:55:12 2000 +0000

    The 'bdist' command, for creating "built" (binary) distributions.
    Initial revision is pretty limited; it only knows how to generate "dumb"
    binary distributions, i.e. a tarball on Unix and a zip file on Windows.
    Also, due to limitations in the installation code, it only knows how to
    distribute Python library code.  But hey, it's a start.

commit 1aab6e964555bf615a853e86c1e2a26e28235803
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 02:53:07 2000 +0000

    Added 'get_inputs()'.

commit ba38d12063919288d6593593493cd37057d0ba67
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 02:52:02 2000 +0000

    Fixed 'get_outputs()' so it actually works.
    Added 'get_inputs()' (which is strikingly similar to 'get_outputs()' - sigh).
    Cosmetic tweaks.

commit 578c10d9a542883428b54ef4684497c31b4cf8d3
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 02:50:04 2000 +0000

    Changed to use the new 'has_pure_modules()' and 'has_ext_modules()' methods
      provided by Distribution.
    Cosmetic and error message tweaks.
    Simplified 'make_release_tree()':
      * extracted 'distutils.util.create_tree()'
      * don't have to do hard-linking ourselves -- it's now handled by
        'distutils.util.copy_file()' (although the detection of
        whether hard linking is available still needs to be factored out)
    Removed 'make_tarball()' and 'make_zipfile()' entirely -- their role
      is now amply filled by 'distutils.util.make_archive()'.
    Simplified 'make_distribution()':
      * use Distribution's new 'get_full_name()' method
      * use 'make_archive()' instead of if/elif/.../else on the archive format

    Bit of cleanup on the projects.
    Some refinements on the Wise file, also adding mmap.pyd.

    Sigh.  On Windows, (mode_t)i fails.  Assume that there's a prototype
    in scope on systems where mode_t isn't the same size as int...

Author: Jeremy Hylton <jeremy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 01:22:54 2000 +0000

    rename args variable in CALL_FUNCTION to callargs (avoids name
    override)
    
    add missing DECREFs in error handling code of CALL_FUNCTION

Date:   Fri Mar 31 01:20:33 2000 +0000

    Mark Hammond: Ooops - even though Win32 handles the same args, there
    was a superfluous check for the platform.

commit a7937e57f354e6d58b2d6c379a97ff3251975ea9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 01:17:42 2000 +0000

    Added mmap project.  (Mark Hammond.)

commit 09fdf07315d0bb1d5d31edad0f19ed326f9a7665
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 01:17:07 2000 +0000

    Hacked for Win32 by Mark Hammond.
    Reformatted for 8-space tabs and fitted into 80-char lines by GvR.
    
    Mark writes:
    
    * the Win32 version now accepts the same args as the Unix version.
    The win32 specific "tag" param is now optional.  The end result is
    that the exact same test suite runs on Windows (definately a worthy
    goal!).
    
    * I changed the error object.  All occurences of the error, except
    for 1, corresponds to an underlying OS error.  This one was changed
    to a ValueError (a better error for that condition), and the module
    error object is now simply EnvironmentError.  All win32 error
    routines now call the new Windows specific error handler.

    New version 1.0.4.  I'm sure someone mailed me these patches but I
    can't remember who. :-)  Changes:
    
    - Support for Windows NT (different locking behavior)
    - Added a logging mechanism

    - Owner name+email made generic instead of GvR
    - Support for Windows NT (running from a .bat file)
    - DOcument <HTML>...</HTML> tags

commit ab5ca15f94af2d617ff68281ca542adaedb4212e
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 00:52:27 2000 +0000

    Fix by Eric Raymond: make the code that looks for various bits of
    tab-setting magic much smarter, more correct, and more easily
    extensible.

commit a1f0a8f4a4d258ca3636e9e8c8d67146f9af6ee4
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 00:51:37 2000 +0000

    Don't use the object call interface in Tk 8.0 -- the EvalObj* API
    changed from 8.0 to 8.1 and I see no big reason to use objects in 8.0.
    At least now it works again with all versions from 8.0 - 8.3.

commit 49679b40b91c30bf6b2ea8aeede9a86c659932b1

    Oops, the previous patch contained a bug in chmod.  Fixed now.

commit ffd15f5255a600fe6cb6fb38123d58eca51f9987
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 00:47:28 2000 +0000

    Two robustness patches:
    
    (1) In opendir(), don't call the lock-release macros; we're
    manipulating list objects and that shouldn't be done in unlocked
    state.
    
    (2) Don't use posix_strint() for chmod() -- the mode_t arg might be a
    64 bit int (reported by Nick Maclaren).

    Couple more names.  We need to add way more names -- I'll have to dig
    them out of the changelogs :-(

commit 6d10887cdc6ac975bf4a62fc62e919c20b319d5b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 31 00:39:23 2000 +0000

    Change traceback error message to "most recent call last" from
    "innermost last".  The latter was mysterious to newbies.

    Use modern PyArg_ParseTuple style, with function names.
    (Mostly.)

    robustify UserList constructor -- will now accept any sequence
    add test cases for non-UserList class, tuple, & string

commit 074c3e62d155349a69442f43e81a73883f222ea9
Author: Jeremy Hylton <jeremy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Mar 30 23:55:31 2000 +0000

    Two fixes for extended call syntax:
    If a non-tuple sequence is passed as the *arg, convert it to a tuple
    before checking its length.
    If named keyword arguments are used in combination with **kwargs, make
    a copy of kwargs before inserting the new keys.

    Audio module for Linux, contributed by Peter Bosch.
    
    Careful, this has had zero testing (except by Peter)!

    Output for simple test case for mmap on Unix; someone needs to write a
        Win32 test case.

Date:   Thu Mar 30 21:14:30 2000 +0000

    Added mmap module -- map a view of a file into memory on Win32 and Unix.
    (Needs testing on Win32.)

    Oops: 'build_extensions()' no longer takes an 'extensions' list.

commit 88716bba55e4811f6566bc89f320722145f1be07
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 30 19:45:39 2000 +0000

    Revamped path access again, by Mark Hammond, to be more robust in the
    light of three different situations: (1) running from build; (2)
    running from installed; (3) running without being able to find an
    installation (e.g. as a COM object).  The system paths in the
    repository are only used for (3); the path deduced from the
    installation location are used otherwise.  PYTHONHOME overrides in all
    cases.
    
    Read the comments for more details.

commit d30dedca27308441014e67a4208f37ce43e7d85c

Date:   Thu Mar 30 15:02:11 2000 +0000

    Michael Hudson: With the (cool!) new call syntax, the longest opcode
    name is much longer, which fouls up dis's formatting slightly; this is
    a "fix" for that.

commit bf45322b3de1f14448db4992e12dd8408e4e740c
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 30 15:00:33 2000 +0000

    Lawrence Kesteloot noted: Lib/user.py has a comment that says that the
    script pointed to by PYTHONPATH will be executed on startup.  That
    should say PYTHONSTARTUP.

    Changes from 1.5.2p2, plus fix a couple of errors noted by Hernan
    Martinez Foffani <hfoffani@sofrecom.com.ar>.

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 21:05:53 2000 +0000

    __pushtodev(): Ignore transient sunaudiodev.errors when setting the
    device info.  I don't know why these occur, but they seem to be
    shortlived and harmless.

commit b2ba9d8963396932b760897f0014dea11f932378
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 18:36:49 2000 +0000

    eval_code2(): Oops, in the last checkin, we shouldn't check for
    PyErr_Occurred(), just set x=NULL and break.  Oh, and make Jeremy stop
    nagging me about the "special" indentation for this block.

commit 4961ef70862c62accdcd9870407eda5908839034
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 18:30:03 2000 +0000

    eval_code2(): In the extended calling syntax opcodes, you must check
    the return value of PySequence_Length().  If an exception occurred,
    the returned length will be -1.  Make sure this doesn't get obscurred,
    and that the bogus length isn't used.

commit 918429b3b286645884d222b48eea8d7cf8fa7556
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 16:02:45 2000 +0000

    Moved robotparser.py to the Lib directory.
    If you do a "cvs update" in the Lib directory, it will pop up there.

    Call 'find_exe()', not '_find_exe()'.

commit ed8a0e0f21360abbe907a3b80e47c854a443eb13
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 03:29:34 2000 +0000

    Patch inspired by Bastian Kleineidam <calvin@cs.uni-sb.de>:
    use global __debug__ flag to determine if compiled files will be ".pyc"
    or ".pyo".  Tweaked compilation output messages too.

commit 044b7c15c9209bdd51710f04ab29ce136d9db202
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 03:27:45 2000 +0000

    Changed 'copy_tree()' so it returns the list of all files that were copied or
    might have been copied, regardless of the 'update' flag.

commit 739d06689dfd37e9233599c3fd95852bb96f71a1
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:56:34 2000 +0000

    Documented Bastian's patch.
    Made handling OSError in 'mkpath()' more standard.

commit da4d1aef4e8f9589956ea7a1e8cf2bbb249cb0eb
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:53:02 2000 +0000

    Patch from Bastian Kleineidam <calvin@cs.uni-sb.de>:
    make 'mkdir()' return list of directories created.

commit 7c1a6d477771955e3773849ef636fceda81bb3d5
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:48:40 2000 +0000

    Added 'make_tarball()' and 'make_zipfile()' functions in preparation
    for the 'bdist_dumb' command.  Adapted, with tweakage, from the 'sdist'
    command.

commit 03d1ae1f0152ef5a6fe4f8a21302387979bd04c9
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:47:29 2000 +0000

    Moved the guts of 'make_tarball()' and 'make_zipfile()' to distutils.util
    in preparation for the 'bdist_dumb' command; these methods remain as
    trivial wrappers around the versions in distutils.util.

commit f00c34da1d0ba4641829adb264fcb20c663b872e
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:20:45 2000 +0000

    Added the "distribution query" methods: 'has_pure_modules()',
    'has_ext_modules()', 'has_c_libraries()', 'has_modules()', and 'is_pure()'.

commit ab9d08ce654be8f555b2a8a08ae56c1e63ba2fec
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:18:39 2000 +0000

    Added 'build_clib'; replaced 'install_py' and 'install_ext' with 'install_lib'.

commit e5dfba5e0fc3f535b58b09ca6ec489562586ceb8
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:17:42 2000 +0000

    Be sure to run both 'build_py' and 'build_ext', now that this command
      is responsible for installing all Python modules (pure and extensions).
    Added 'get_outputs()' in preparation for the 'bdist' command, and
      '_mutate_outputs()' to support 'get_outputs()'.

commit ee94c57fe960b5a986721fdb813caae1dfb2144e
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:15:57 2000 +0000

    Changed so the sub-commands we rely on to do the real work is specified
      in a class attribute 'sub_commands', rather than hard-coded in 'run()'.
      This should make it easier to subclass 'install', and also makes it
      easier to keep 'run()' and the new 'get_outputs()' consistent.
    Added 'get_outputs()' in preparation for the 'bdist' command.

commit ae45b16157cad4b6d3fd844b4684bc538549ddc5
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:14:21 2000 +0000

    Use the new 'has_pure_modules()', 'has_ext_modules()', 'has_c_libraries()'
    methods of Distribution instead of grovelling directly in self.distribution.

commit 4d16e0ac20a6eef119cab8950b7455fa7abdbf71
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:13:09 2000 +0000

    Added 'get_outputs()' in prepartion for the 'bdist' command.
    Changed signature of 'build_extensions()': no longer takes the extension
      list, but uses 'self.extensions' (just like 'get_outputs()' has to)
    Moved call to 'check_extensions_list()' from 'run()' to 'build_extensions()',
      again for consistency with 'get_outputs()'.

commit 8b2e95edd69cacafdfbcf00270065bd6444f3336
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 02:10:51 2000 +0000

    Deleted some crufty comments and code.
    A host of improvements in preparation for the 'bdist' command:
      - added 'get_outputs()' method (all the other improvements were to support
        this addition)
      - made 'find_package_modules()' and 'find_modules()' return similar
        values (list of (package, module, module_filename) tuples)
      - factored 'find_all_modules()' out of 'get_source_files()' (needed
        by 'get_outputs()')
      - factored 'get_module_outfile()' out of 'build_module()' (also needed
        by 'get_outputs()')
      - various little tweaks, improvements, comment/doc updates

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 01:49:47 2000 +0000

    Changes to completely ignore the registry when it detects that you are
    running out of the build directory.  This means that it will no longer
    try to use an older version of the library when an older version has
    been installed.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 01:48:29 2000 +0000

    Change the pragmas to use python16.lib instead of python15.lib.  (Took
    me half an hour to find why it was still linking with python15.dll!)

commit 21a50bd07892b9d53ffa36c5d6644ce00b34057b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 01:46:45 2000 +0000

    Version updated to 1.6; API version to 1009.

commit 632de2702183468721ef98e2a2ded249baa663b3
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 00:19:50 2000 +0000

    The Tcl_Obj patch discussed on the patches list.
    
    This was originally submitted by Martin von Loewis as part of his
    Unicode patch; all I did was add special cases for Python int and
    float objects and rearrange the object type tests somewhat to speed up
    the common cases (string, int, float, tuple, unicode, object).

commit 7690151c7e95f38b91a9c572ce29b4d8a4ca671d
Author: Jeremy Hylton <jeremy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Mar 28 23:49:17 2000 +0000

    slightly modified version of Greg Ewing's extended call syntax patch
    
    executive summary:
    Instead of typing 'apply(f, args, kwargs)' you can type 'f(*arg, **kwargs)'.
    Some file-by-file details follow.
    
    Grammar/Grammar:
        simplify varargslist, replacing '*' '*' with '**'
        add * & ** options to arglist

    Fredrik Lundh:
    
    The new filecmp module has an optional argument called use_statcache
    which is documented as a true/false value, but used as an tuple index.
    
    This patches replaces the tuple stuff with a good old if- statement,
    and also removes a few other tuple pack/unpack constructs (if not
    else, this saves a few bytes in the PYC file, and a few microseconds
    when using the module ;-).

    Marc-Andre Lemburg:
    
    The attached patch set includes a workaround to get Python with
    Unicode compile on BSDI 4.x (courtesy Thomas Wouters; the cause
    is a bug in the BSDI wchar.h header file) and Python interfaces
    for the MBCS codec donated by Mark Hammond.
    
    Also included are some minor corrections w/r to the docs of
    the new "es" and "es#" parser markers (use PyMem_Free() instead
    of free(); thanks to Mark Hammond for finding these).
    
    The unicodedata tests are now in a separate file
    (test_unicodedata.py) to avoid problems if the module cannot
    be found.

    Piers Lauder:
    
    This patch fixes the "search" command in imaplib. The problem
    was that a search can take multiple arguments, but as defined,
    would only accept one.
    
    I have also made changes to the test code at the end to be less
    verbose by default, but to accept a verbosity argument.

    Skip Montanaro:
    
    The robotparser.py module currently lives in Tools/webchecker.  In
    preparation for its migration to Lib, I made the following changes:
    
        * renamed the test() function _test
        * corrected the URLs in _test() so they refer to actual documents
        * added an "if __name__ == '__main__'" catcher to invoke _test()
          when run as a main program
        * added doc strings for the two main methods, parse and can_fetch
        * replaced usage of regsub and regex with corresponding re code

    adds more tests for the codecs and two new parser markers
    "es" and "es#".

    Fix probable bug; if errno == EINTR, floatsleep() doesn't break out of
       a Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS/Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS block, but it
       calls Py_BLOCK_THREADS anyway. The change moves Py_BLOCK_THREADS
       to inside the if, so it's only executed when the function
       actually returns unexpectedly.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Mar 22 00:30:54 2000 +0000

    Dropped any notion of allowing the user to specify the build directories:
    these must come from the 'build' command.  This means we no longer need
    the misconceived 'set_peer_option()' method in Command and, more importantly,
    sweeps away a bunch of potential future complexity to handle this tricky
    case.

    Renamed 'install_path' to 'extra_path'.
    Fix 'Command.set_undefined_option()' to call 'ensure_ready()' rather
      than 'finalize_options()' (which is only supposed to be called once,
      which is the whole point of 'ensure_ready()').
    Added comment to 'set_peer_option()' to remind myself that this method
      cannot work and is fundamentally wrong-headed.

    Yet another complete rewrite.  Hopefully the *last* complete rewrite of
    this command for a while; this implements roughly the plan cooked up by
    Guido, Fred, and me.  Seems to strike a nice balance between usability in
    the common cases (just set one option), expandability for more types of
    files to install in future, and customizability of installation
    directories.
    
    This revision isn't completely working: standard and alternate
    installations work fine, but there are still some kinks to work out of
    customized installations.

    irrelevant because this file is about to go away, but oh well.

        Attached you find an update of the Unicode implementation.
    
        The patch is against the current CVS version. I would appreciate
        if someone with CVS checkin permissions could check the changes
        in.
    
        The patch contains all bugs and patches sent this week and also
        fixes a leak in the codecs code and a bug in the free list code
        for Unicode objects (which only shows up when compiling Python
        with Py_DEBUG; thanks to MarkH for spotting this one).

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sat Mar 18 17:36:09 2000 +0000

    Simplified doc string.
    Added 'clean' to list of commands.

commit 89ccb984f013a3ad5664982189b8d29e944f1375
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sat Mar 18 17:35:12 2000 +0000

    Oops!  Don't call 'ensure_ready()' in 'Distribution.find_command_obj()' --
    that broke parsing command-line options.  Instead call it in
    'Command.find_peer()', which is why I added it to 'find_command_obj()'
    in the first place.

    Tweaked all over:
      * improve help strings
      * warn if user supplies non-existing directories
      * don't try to 'remove_tree()' non-existing directories
      * try to remove the build_base after cleanup (but don't do or say
        anything if it fails -- this is just in case we made it empty)

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sat Mar 18 15:19:51 2000 +0000

    Changed to pay attention to the 'runtime_library_dirs' list (= 'rpath'
    option in the 'build_ext' command):
      * in ccompiler.py: 'gen_lib_options()' now takes 'runtime_library_dirs'
        parameter
      * in unixccompiler.py and msvccompiler.py: now pass
        'self.runtime_library_dirs' to 'gen_lib_options()', and define
        'runtime_library_dir_option()' (although in msvccompiler.py it
        blows up with a DistutilsPlatformError right now!)

    Third attempt at documenting an installation scheme; this one feels like
    it could work--reasonably short and straightforward to document, but
    flexible enough that it will be able to handle more than just modules
    and extensions in the future.

    complete rewrite
    
    code generator uses flowgraph as intermediate representation.  the old
        rep uses a list with explicit "StackRefs" to indicate the target

    Checking in the new, improve file.writelines() code.
    
    This (1) avoids thread unsafety whereby another thread could zap the
    list while we were using it, and (2) now supports writing arbitrary
    sequences of strings.

    Christian Tismer's "trashcan" patch:
    
    Added wrapping macros to dictobject.c, listobject.c, tupleobject.c,
    frameobject.c, traceback.c that safely prevends core dumps
    on stack overflow. Macros and functions in object.c, object.h.
    The method is an "elevator destructor" that turns cascading
    deletes into tail recursive behavior when some limit is hit.

    [from 2000-02-25] Second attempt at describing an installation scheme; this is
    the simplified scheme that Guido proposed.  Also already-obsolete,
    and saved only for posterity.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Mar 10 01:49:26 2000 +0000

    Renamed 'link_static_lib() to 'create_static_lib()', and rewrote it create
    a static library (using lib.exe as found by '__init__()', hopefully through
    registry entries pointing to DevStudio).

    There are a few places which can raise DistutilsPlatformError; make
    sure it's imported!  ;)
    
    Re-wrap the docstrings on get_python_inc() and get_python_lib() to be
    closer to the "normal" Python style.  See GvR's "style guide" on the
    essays page (http://www.python.org/doc/essays/).
    
    There should never be a space between a function name and the '(' that
    opens the argument list (see the style guide again).

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Thu Mar 9 03:16:05 2000 +0000

    Added Joe Van Andel's 'get_python_inc()', adapted by me to supply
      the platform-neutral include dir by default and with Mac support.
    Added 'get_python_lib()', inspired by 'get_python_inc()'.
    Rewrote 'get_config_h_filename()' and 'get_makefile_filename()'
      in terms of 'get_python_inc()' and 'get_python_lib()'.
    Changed '_init_nt()' and '_init_mac()' to use 'get_python_inc()' and
      'get_python_lib()' for directory names.

    Handles were never disposed. Added an AutoDispose(onoff) method to control this.
    Also added a Handle() function which is like Resource() but has auto-dispose on by default.

    A bunch of changes, primarily to command line argument parsing
    (inspired by Detlef Lannert).  Specifically,
    
        -k/--keyword no longer takes an optional argument to clear the
        default keywords.  Instead, use -K/--no-default-keywords to clear
        them.
    
        -n/--add-location also no longer takes an optional argument to set
        the comment style.  Instead, use -S/--style to set the comment
        style to GNU or Solaris.
    
        -o/--output can take `-' as the filename, meaning write to
        standard output.
    
        The inputfile name can also be `-' meaning read from standard in.
    
    A few other changes include
    
        Kludge to mark the file docstring as translatable.  Since the
        marking is to place _() around the docstring, and because we
        actually have to define the _() function before we use it, this
        means that we have to manually assign to __doc__ the output of
        _().  This doesn't seem too bad because you'll only use this idiom
        when translating a script's docstring (you really don't need to
        translate most module docstrings).
    
        Convert everything to string methods and do not import the string
        module.
    
        Bump the version number to 1.1

    Override the Undo delegator to forbid any changes before the I/O mark.
    It beeps if you try to insert or delete before the "iomark" mark.
    This makes the shell less confusing for newbies.

    Tweak the goto file/line command (in the right button menu in PyShell
    and output windows) so that it if it doesn't succeed with the line
    at the cursor, it tries the line before that.  This is handy with
    tracebacks, where my natural tendency is to click in the displayed
    source line rather than in the file/line indicator just above it.
    Now I can indulge this tendency.
    
    I factored out a helper and changed the error handling so that a
    non-existing file is treated as if the line didn't match -- this is
    handy because some function calls (e.g. "foo.bar(1)") match the grep
    pattern.

    If we're in the current input and there's only whitespace beyond the
    cursor, erase that whitespace first.  This avoids a particularly
    confusing case where hitting Return at the end of the command didn't
    do what it was expected to do -- because it wasn't considered to be at
    the end of the command.  Now it is.

    Serious overhaul of the C compiler interface and the two classes that
    implement it (so far):
      * moved filename generation methods into CCompiler base class,
        driven by data supplied by implementation classes
      * moved a bunch of common code from UnixCCompiler to convenience
        methods in CCompiler
      * overhauled MSVCCompiler's compile/link methods to look and act
        as much as possible like UnixCCompiler's, in order to regularize
        both interface and behaviour (especially by using those new
        convenience methods)

    If the "build_lib" command built any C libraries, link with them all
      when building extensions (uses build_lib's 'get_library_names()' method).
    Ensure that the relative structure of source filenames is preserved in
      the temporary build tree, eg. foo/bar.c compiles to
      build/temp.<plat>/foo/bar.o.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Thu Mar 2 01:27:36 2000 +0000

    Added command description.
    Added 'build_clib' and 'build_temp' options (where to put C libraries
      and where to put temporary compiler by-products, ie. object files).
    Moved the call to 'check_library_list()' from 'run()' to 'finalize_options()'
      -- that way, if we're going to crash we do so earlier, and we guarantee
      that the library list is valid before we do anything (not just run).
    Disallow directory separators in library names -- the compiled library
      always goes right in 'build_clib'.
    Added 'get_library_names()', so the "build_ext" command knows what
      libraries to link every extension with.

    In the 'compile()' method: preserve the directory portion of source
    filenames when constructing object filenames, even if output_dir given --
    eg. "foo/bar.c" will compile to "foo/bar.o" without an output_dir, and to
    "temp/foo/bar.o" if output_dir is "temp".

    Build reorg:

      * change 'build_extensions()' to put object files (compiler turds) in
        'build_temp' dir
      * complicated the name-of-extension-file shenanigans in
        'build_extensions()' to support "in-place" extension building, i.e.
        put the extension right into the source tree (handy for developers)
      * added 'get_ext_fullname()', renamed 'extension_filename()' to
        'get_ext_filename()', and tweaked the latter a bit -- all to support
        the new filename shenanigans

    Patch by Fred Gansevles (the module's original author).
    
    This patch fixes 3 small problems.
    1) If a map is used which is generated with 'makedbm -a',
       the trailing '\0' is now handled correctely.
    2) The nis.maps() function skipped the first map in the output list.
    3) The library '-lnsl' is added in Setup.in (needed on Linux glibc2 and
       Solaris systems. Maybe on other systems too?)
    
    [I note that this still doesn't work when you are using NIS+ --GvR]

    Drop the support level for stdwin a notch -- the contents of
    lib-stdwin is no longer installed.
    
    Increase the support level for other obsolete modules a bit: install
    lib-old by default.  It still isn't in the path by default, but at
    least it's easier to add to your $PYTHONPATH this way.  (This makes
    sense because in 1.6 we're much more aggressive with declaring modules
    obsolete.)

    Changes submitted by Peter Funk (some fixes/additions by B.Warsaw) to
    make pygettext more compatible with GNU xgettext, specifically:
    
    Added -E/--escape for allowing pass-thru of iso8859-1 characters above
    7 bits.
    
    Added -o/--output option for renaming the output file from
    messages.pot (there's overlap with -d/--default-domain, but GNU
    xgettext has them both).
    
    Added -p/--output-dir for specifying the output directory for
    messages.pot.
    
    Added -V/--version for printing the version number.
    
    Added -w/--width for specifying the output page width (this is because
    now pygettext, like GNU xgettext will put several locations on the
    same line to cut down on vertical space).
    
    Added -x/--exclude-file for specifying a list of strings that are not
    to be extracted from the input files.
    
    Bumped version number to 1.0
    
    Try to import fintl and use fintl.gettext as _ if available.  Fall
    back is to use identity definition of _().
    
    Moved the escape creation to a function make_escapes() so that its
    behavior can be controlled by the -E option.
    
    __openseen(): Support the -x option.
    
    write(): Support -w option and vertical space preserving feature.
    
    main(): Support new options.

    Changes inspired by Randall Hooper to allow callbacks when an
    OptionMenu is modified.  Somewhat rewritten and elaborated by myself.
    
    class _setit: The constructor now takes an optional argument
    `callback' and stashes this in a private variable.  If set, the
    __call__() method will invoke this callback after the variable's value
    has changed.  It will pass the callback the value, followed by any
    args passed to __call__().
    
    class OptionMenu: The constructor now takes keyword arguments, the
    only one that's legally recognized is `command', which can be set to a
    callback.  This callback is invoked when the OptionMenu value is set.
    Any other keyword argument throws a TclError.

    Pat Knight:
    
    Solaris 2 has stub implementations of the POSIX thread functions such as
    pthread_detach in libc. This means that configure tries to use them without
    -lpthread, then the test of pthread_create fails and the configuration
    falls back to the Solaris thread library. This patch moves the test for
    pthread_create in -lpthread ahead of the test for pthread_detach in libc.
    The patch also ensures that -lpthread is at the start of the library list
    when linking, to pick up POSIX thread semantics for fork (see below).
    
    Justification.
    Use of POSIX threads on Solaris ensures that the fork() call only runs the
    thread that called fork() in the child. This is desirable to prevent (for
    example) parent server or database threads running in the child. Sun's
    -lthread library uses a traditional fork() which replicates all the
    parent's threads in the child. I find this undesirable.
    
    Digression.
    The configure.in seems to always test for -lthread even if a POSIX library
    is found. I'm not enough of a configure.in wizard to decide whether this is
    desirable or how to fix it. It is also irrelevant to this patch - I just
    spotted it while testing.
    End of Digression.

    This patch allows building the Python 'mpzmodule' under SuSE Linux
    without having to install the source package of the GMP-libary.
    The gmp-mparam.h seems to be an internal header file.  The patch
    shouldn't hurt any other platforms.

    Made all list methods use PyArg_ParseTuple(), for more accurate
    diagnostics.
    
    *** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: This changes append(), remove(), index(), and
    *** count() to require exactly one argument -- previously, multiple
    *** arguments were silently assumed to be a tuple.

    of the current module.  It also runs the tabnanny to catch any
    inconsistent tabs.
    
    Also did a little bit of refactoring: added an errorbox() method to
    simplify the display of error dialogs.

    Patch from Vladimir Marangozov <marangoz@python.inrialpes.fr>
            The same problem (mixed mallocs) exists for the pcre stack.
            The buffers md->... are allocated via PyMem_RESIZE in grow_stack(),
            while in free_stack() they are released with free() instead of
            PyMem_DEL().

    The 'sdist' command to create a source distribution.  This is derived from the
    old 'dist' command, but the code for dealing with manifests is completely
    redone -- and renaming the command to 'sdist' is more symmetric with the
    soon-to-exist 'bdist' command.

    the previous quick hack to fix def foo((x,y)) failed on some cases
    (big surprise).  new solution is a little less hackish.
    
    Code gen adds a TupleArg instance in the argument slot. The tuple arg
    includes a copy of the names that it is responsble for binding.  The
    PyAssembler uses this information to calculate the correct argcount.
    
    all fix this wacky case: del (a, ((b,), c)), d
    which is the same as: del a, b, c, d
    (Can't wait for Guido to tell me why.)
    
    solution uses findOp which walks a tree to find out whether it
    contains OP_ASSIGN or OP_DELETE or ...

    Patches by Piers Lauder.
    
    Reasons for patches:
    
    1st patch (15,21):
            version change
    
    2nd patch (66,72):
            This is a patch I found in a Zope product release (quite by accident!).
            It relaxes the conditions for matching a literal. I've looked over the
            logic, and tested it, and it seems sensible.
    
    3rd patch (117,123):
            It appears the quoting matcher was too general, and that the IMAP4
            protocol requires characters like ':' in commands to be unquoted.
            (This is the patch already sent to Guido.)
    
    4th patch (699,705):
            Spelling correction in comment.
    
    5th patch (753,761):
            Another patch from the Zope product. It seems that some IMAP4 servers
            produce unexpected responses in the middle of valid command/response
            sequences. This patch ignores the unexpected responses in this
            situation. (How I wish users would send me bug reports with examples!).
    
    last 2 patches: (1015,1028) (1038,1044):
            Minor improvements to test code.

    Patch by Mark Hammond:
    
    * Changes to a recent patch by Chris Tismer to errors.c.  Chris' patch
    always used FormatMessage() to get the error message passing the error code
    from errno - but errno and FormatMessage use a different numbering scheme.
    The main reason the patch looked OK was that ENOFILE==ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND -
    but that is about the only shared error code :-).  The MS CRT docs tell you
    to use _sys_errlist()/_sys_nerr.  My patch does also this, and adds a very
    similar function specifically for win32 error codes.

    The patch includes code that says:
    +  Copyright (C) 1986 Gary S. Brown.  You may use this program, or
    +  code or tables extracted from it, as desired without restriction.
    
    My interpretation (and Jim's) is that Gary S Brown has no claims under
    copyright, patent or other rights or interests.  Lawyers might disagree.

    add support for Lambda nodes
    
    change resolution of local name ops (LOAD_FAST).  i think it makes
    sense now.  if it is an argument or a local var name that it used, it
    must be in varnames.  if it is a local var name that is used, it must
    also be in names

    Ditched '_find_SET()', since it was a no-value-added wrapper around
      'get_msvc_paths()'.
    Renamed '_do_SET()' to 'set_path_env_var()', tweaked docstring, and
      cosmetically tweaked code.
    Stylistic changes to MSVCCompiler constructor (variable renaming
      and type consistency).

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Fri Feb 11 02:47:15 2000 +0000

    Latest patch from Thomas Heller/Robin Becker:
      * tweak my docstrings
      * fix None returns to empty list
      * reshuffle responsibilities between '_find_exe()', '_find_SET()', and
        the MSVCCompiler constructor -- now the constructor worries about
        fetching the version list and determining the most recent one
      * added "/W3" compile option
    Also, I added/tweaked some docstrings.

Date:   Thu Feb 10 20:26:45 2000 +0000

    Document the API changes to the nntplib module (exceptions become
    classes, NNTP.__init__() grows a new optional argument to set reader
    mode on the server).

commit 9dd78729459478023a46401d8f04e2dc3bf974e5
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 10 20:25:53 2000 +0000

    Added new exception classes:
    
        NNTPError - derived from Exception, it's the base class for all
        other exceptions in this module
    
        NNTPReplyError - what used to be error_reply
    
        NNTPTemporaryError - what used to be error_temp
    
        NNTPPermanentError - what used to be error_perm
    
        NNTPProtocolError - what used to be error_proto
    
        NNTPDataError - what used to be error_data
    
    All the old names are retained for backwards compatibility; they point
    to the class that replaces them.  Also, any code in this module that
    raises an exception, now does so with the exception class.
    
    NNTP.__init__(): Added a new optional argument `readermode', which is
    a flag that defaults to false.  When set to true, the "mode reader"
    command is sent to the NNTP server before user authentication.  Reader
    mode is sometimes necessary if you are connecting to an NNTP server on
    the local machine and intend to call reader-specific comamnds, such as
    `group'.  If you get unexpected NNTPPermanentErrors, you might need to
    set readermode.  Patch provided by Thomas Wouters (who include the
    standard disclaimer on is patches@python.org submission), and inspired
    by Jim Tittsler.

    add namespace attr to CodeGenerator, can be either MODULE_NAMESPACE or
    FUNCTION_NAMESPACE.  initialize in __init__ and reset in
    generateFunctionCode.
    
    replace direct issue of STORE_FAST, STORE_GLOBAL, etc. with call to
    storeName; same for loadName and deleteName
    
    the new {store,load,delete}Name methods use the namespace attr and the
    local variable stack to determine the correct bytecode to issue

      * add debug flags for compile and link, and use them

    * prints out examples of nodes that are handled by visitor.  simply a
      development convenience
    
    remove NestedCodeGenerator -- it was bogus after all
    replace with generateFunctionCode, a method to call to generate code
      for a function instead of a top-level module
    
    fix impl of visitDiscard (most pop stack)
    emit lineno for pass
    
    handle the following new node types: Import, From, Getattr, Subscript,
    Slice, AssAttr, AssTuple, Mod, Not, And, Or, List

    Added 'debug' flags to compile and link methods, and added dummy code for
      someone who knows Windows/MSVC++ to come along and add the right flags.
    Comment noting that 'link_static_lib()' signature is inconsistent with
      the other compiler classes (uh-oh!)

    rapid evolution towards producing real .pyc files (even though I don't
    handle most of the language syntax yet)
    
    create NestedCodeGenerator used to generator the separate code object
    that needs to be passed as an argument to MAKE_FUNCTION when a def
    stmt is found (probably useful for class too)
    
    change CodeGenerator.visitFunction to use the NestedCG
    
    add CompiledModule class to handle creation of .pyc (pretty minimal
    for now)
    
    add makeCodeObject method to PythonVMCode that replaces symbolic names
    with indexes into slots of the code code.  the design of this
    class will probably need to be revised.

    Actually, the previous batch's comment should have been different;
    *this* set of patches is Ka-Ping's final sweep:
    
    The attached patches update the standard library so that all modules
    have docstrings beginning with one-line summaries.
    
    A new docstring was added to formatter.  The docstring for os.py
    was updated to mention nt, os2, ce in addition to posix, dos, mac.

    More trivial comment -> docstring transformations by Ka-Ping Yee,
    who writes:
    
    Here is batch 2, as a big collection of CVS context diffs.
    Along with moving comments into docstrings, i've added a
    couple of missing docstrings and attempted to make sure more
    module docstrings begin with a one-line summary.
    
    I did not add docstrings to the methods in profile.py for
    fear of upsetting any careful optimizations there, though
    i did move class documentation into class docstrings.
    
    The convention i'm using is to leave credits/version/copyright
    type of stuff in # comments, and move the rest of the descriptive
    stuff about module usage into module docstrings.  Hope this is
    okay.

    Mass patch by Ka-Ping Yee:
    
        1. Comments at the beginning of the module, before
           functions, and before classes have been turned
           into docstrings.
    
        2. Tabs are normalized to four spaces.
    
    Also, removed the "remove" function from dircmp.py, which reimplements
    list.remove() (it must have been very old).

    When authentication is needed, the default http_error_401 method calls
    retry_http_basic_auth.  The default version of that method expected a
    data argument which wasn't provided, so now we provide the argument if
    it was given and we also made the data argument optional.
    
    Also changed other calls where data was optional to not pass data if

    Added 'description' class attribute to every command class (to help the

    Shuffled imports around in a few command modules to avoid expensive
      up-front import of sysconfig (and resulting delays in generating list

    Improvements to the help system:
      * "--help" can now come either before or after particular commands
        to get help on and can give help on multiple commands, eg.
        "--help install dist" gives help on those two commands

    Big oops: macfs has always been using a private exception but calling it mac.error.
    It now uses MacOS.Error (the OSErr valued error) and advertises that too. This
    fix shouldn't break anything, I guess.

    Fix a bug in exec_statement() noted incidentally by Tim Peters in
    PR#175 -- when exec is passed a code object, it didn't sync the locals
    from the dictionary back into their fast representation.
    
    Also took the time to remove some repetitive code there and to do the
    syncing even when an exception is raised (since a partial effect
    should still be synced).

    The functions asctime() and mktime() are documented to take a 9-tuple
    only.  Through some mysterious interaction, they would take 9 separate
    arguments as well.  This misfeature is now disabled (to end a

    Abstracted '_fix_link_args()' out of 'link_shared_object()'.
    Added 'link_static_lib()' method, and 'archiver' and 'archiver_options'
      class attributes to support it.
    Added 'link_executable()' method, and 'ld_exec' instance attribute
      to support it.
    'newer_group()' is now able to handle missing files, so we don't have
      to kludge it by catching OSError when calling it.
    'object_filenames()' and 'shared_object_filename()' now take 'keep_dir'
      flag parameters.
    'library_filename()' and 'shared_library_filename()' now respect
      a directory component in the library name.
    Various comment updates/deletions.

    long_format():  Now takes a third parameter, addL; iff true, a
                    trailing 'L' is appended to the representation,
                    otherwise not.

                    function from elsewhere; it's static!
    
    long_str():     Handler for the tp_str slot in the type object.
                    Identical to long_repr(), but passes false as the addL
                    parameter of long_format().

    Cleanup patches from Greg Stein:
    
    * in import.c, #ifdef out references to dynamic loading based on
      HAVE_DYNAMIC_LOADING
    
    * clean out the platform-specific crud from importdl.c.
      [ maybe fold this function into import.c and drop the importdl.c file? Greg.]
    
    * change GetDynLoadFunc's "funcname" parameter to "shortname". change
      "name" to "fqname" for clarification.
    
    * each GetDynLoadFunc now creates its own funcname value.
    
      WARNING: as I mentioned previously, we may run into an issue with a
      missing "_" on some platforms. Testing will show this pretty quickly,
      however.
    
    * move pathname munging into dynload_shlib.c

    Contribution from Gerrit Holl:
    
    This patch changes the string-based exceptions to class-based
    exceptions, so that you can fetch the unknown option as an
    attribute.  As far as I know, it is backward compatible.
    
    [The new exception class is called GetoptError; the name error is an
    alias for compatibility.]

    Vladimir Marangozov:
    
    Here's a patch that avoids a warning caused by the "const char* pathname"
    declaration for _PyImport_GetDynLoadFunc (in dynload_aix). The "aix_load"
    function's 1st arg is prototyped as "char *pathname".

    The old platform-specific contents of importdl.c, broken down into one
    file per platform (really: per style of Dl API; e.g. all platforms
    using dlopen() are grouped together in dynload_shlib.c.).

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 15 18:31:10 1999 +0000

    Rip out the code to check the ordering of the tables used to map
    strings to integers for the *conf*() functions.
    
    Added code to sort the tables at module initialization.  Three
    dictionaries, confstr_names, sysconf_names, and pathconf_names, are
    added to the module as well.  These map known configuration setting
    names to the numeric value which is used to represent the setting in
    the system call.  This code is always called.
    
    Updated related comments.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>

    Added table entries for Irix 6.5 names for confstr()/sysconf()/
    pathconf() names, from Sjoerd.
    
    Added code to verify that these tables are properly ordered, only
    included and used when CHECK_CONFNAME_TABLES is defined.  This is only
    needed to test the tables, so I haven't enabled this by default.

    Only set msg.fp to None when there are no extra arguments; if there
    are, we must keep the file around so we can print the body.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 14 21:25:03 1999 +0000

    Added support for getlogin(); does *not* use getlogin_r() where
    available since the interface is poorly defined on at least one major
    platform (Solaris).
    
    Moved table of constant names for fpathconf() & pathconf() into the
    conditional that defines the conv_path_confname() helper; Mark Hammond
    reported that defining the table when none of the constants were
    defined causes the compiler to complain (won't allow 0-length array,
    imagine that!).
    
    In posix_fpathconf(), use conv_path_confname() as the O& conversion
    function, instead of the conv_confname() helper, which has the wrong
    signature (posix_pathconf() already used the right thing).

    Remove test for getlogin_r(); the interface is not clearly defined, at
    least on Solaris (sometimes it's Unix98, sometimes it conforms to an
    early draft).
    
    Properly generate config.h.in using autoheader instead of editing it
    manually; thanks, Guido!

    Bgen now understands more constant definitions, but that means that a few which are not parseable in Python have to be blacklisted.

    If a menu shortcut is a tuple in stead of a char it is a tuple (modifierkeys, char [, glyph]).

    V 2.16 from Piers:
    
            I've changed the login command to force proper
            quoting of the password argument. I've also added
            some extra debugging code, which is removed when
            __debug__ is false.

    *Lots* of tables to define names used by *conf*(); explanation to go

    Methods {Get,Set}ControlData that know about data types passed for the various
    4-char codes. The table which maps codes to datatypes is still pretty empty,
    I'll fill it as I need entries (or maybe someone wants to spend a nice day filling it?).

Date:   Sun Dec 12 22:57:29 1999 +0000

    In places where a ResObj is expected for PyArg_Parse and the object passed in isn't but it does have an as_Resource method use that. This makes life a lot easier
    for appearance portability (and was needed anyway).

    Regenerated toolbox modules with CW Pro 5.2, which has MacOS 8.6 and Appearance 1.1 support, and added workaround for non-existing calls for 68K.
    Static 68K Python still has a tk problem.

Date:   Sun Dec 12 21:38:29 1999 +0000

    Dummy functions which return unimpErr for lots of toolbox calls that are unavailable for 68K. This way we don't have to disable thm in bgen, so we
    can still use them on PPC.

    Catch up with terminology change in UnixCCompiler: 'includes' -> 'include_dirs'.

commit 1d0495e05c3c1155e5a1830bdeddf4ad9d4afc87
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Dec 12 17:07:22 1999 +0000

    Catch missing MANIFEST file and warn rather than blowing up.
    Added 'nuke_release_tree()' method to blow away the directory from
      which the archive file(s) are created, and call it (conditionally)
      from 'make_distribution()'.
    Added 'keep_tree' option (false by default) to disable the call to
      'nuke_release_tree()'.

commit 9b45443c1bdf99b0f27b12baf06fea475b60e145
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Dec 12 17:03:59 1999 +0000

    Fixed 'find_package_modules()' to ensure that we never build (and thus
      install) the setup script itself.
    Fixed 'build_module()' so we do *not* preserve file mode (which means
      we can install read-only files, which makes the next installation
      of this distribution fail -- at least under Unix); added a comment
      explaining this.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Dec 12 17:01:01 1999 +0000

    Changed 'build_extensions()' so 'sources' can be a list or tuple; and
      call CCompiler method 'compile()' with 'include_dirs' not 'includes'.
    Fixed stupid typo in 'get_source_files()'.

commit 04d78328f39864cada04591ebb1d99ad30671cec
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Dec 12 16:57:47 1999 +0000

    In 'compile()' method, renamed 'includes' parameter to 'include_dirs' for
      consistency with 'build_ext' command option.
    Changed 'compile()' and 'link_shared_object()' so 'include_dirs',
      'libraries', and 'library_dirs' can be lists or tuples.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Dec 12 16:54:55 1999 +0000

    Added support for printing out help text from option table: 'print_help()',
      'generate_help()', 'wrap_text()' functions, and a little tiny test
      of 'wrap_text()'.
    Changed how caller states that one option is the boolean opposite of
      another: added 'negative_opt' parameter to 'fancy_getopt()', and changed
      to use it instead of parsing long option name.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Dec 12 16:51:44 1999 +0000

    Made "verbose" mode the default; now you have to supply --quiet if you
      want no output.  Still no option for a happy medium though.
    Added "--help" global option.
    Changed 'parse_command_line()' to recognize help options (both for the
      whole distribution and per-command), and to distinguish "regular run"
      and "user asked for help" by returning false in the latter case.
    Also in 'parse_command_line()', detect invalid command name on command
      line by catching DistutilsModuleError.
      a 'negative_opt' class attribute right after 'global_options'; changed
      how we call 'fancy_getopt()' accordingly.
    Initialize 'maintainer' and 'maintainer_email' attributes to Distribution
      to avoid AttributeError when 'author' and 'author_email' not defined.
    Initialize 'help' attribute in Command constructor (to avoid
      AttributeError when user *doesn't* ask for help).
    In 'setup()':
      * show usage message before dying when we catch DistutilsArgError
      * only run commands if 'parse_command_line()' returned true (that
        way, we exit immediately when a help option is found)
      * catch KeyboardInterrupt and IOError from running commands
    Bulked up usage message to show --help options.
    Comment, docstring, and error message tweaks.

    Added support for abort(), ctermid(), tmpfile(), tempnam(), tmpnam(),
    and TMP_MAX.
    
    Converted all functions that used PyArg_Parse() or PyArg_NoArgs() to
    use PyArg_ParseTuple() and specified all function names using the
    :name syntax in the format strings, to allow better error messages
    when TypeError is raised for parameter type mismatches.

    First bits and pieces of appearance support: an init routine, a global flag PyMac_AppearanceCompliant (exported thru MacOS). If USE_APPEARANCE
    is off the code is disabled (but the variables are still there, set to 0).

    [from 1999-11-04]
    Bunch of little bug fixes that appeared in building non-packagized
    distributions.  Mainly:
      - brain-slip typo in 'get_package_dir()'
      - don't try to os.path.join() an empty path tuple -- it doesn't like it
      - more type-safety in 'build_module()'

    add SysPathImporter and BuiltinImporter
    put __file__ into modules imported from the filesystem. [backwards compat]

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 19 21:57:56 1999 +0000

    Moved all the imports to the top.
    
    Use the methods on the AST object instead of module-level functions;
    these have been implemented for a couple of versions now, and are
    already used in the module documentation in preference to the
    functions.

    When generating the top-level index to the documents, make sure some
    oddball things from the LaTeX get translated to rational values.  This
    is mostly to keep things from looking broken in a development tree
    when they're not.

    Patches by Kannan Vijayan:
    
    new:
    readline.get_begidx() -> int
            gets the beginning index in the command line string
            delimiting the tab-completion scope.  This would
            probably be used from within a tab-completion
            handler
    
    readline.get_endidx() -> int
            gets the ending index in the command line string
            delimiting the tab-completion scope.  This would
            probably be used from within a tab-compeltion
            handler
    
    readline.set_completer_delims(string) -> None
            sets the delimiters used by readline as word breakpoints
            for tab-completion
    
    readline.get_completer_delims() -> string
            gets the delimiters used by readline as word breakpoints
            for tab-completion
    
    fixed:
    readline.get_line_buffer() -> string
            doesnt cause a debug message every other call

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 17 15:40:08 1999 +0000

    Integrated Sam Bayer's wcnew.py code.  It seems silly to keep two
    files.  Removed Sam's "SLB" change comments; otherwise this is the
    same as wcnew.py.

    # and removed trailing whitespace.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 17 15:04:26 1999 +0000

    Samuel L. Bayer:
    
    - same trick with "import wcnew; webchecker = wcnew" as above
    - updated readhtml() method to handle pair representation; used
      new name suppression infrastructure from wcnew.py to suppress
      processing name anchors
    
    [And untabified --GvR]

commit a8946406dfd6f4ecaf090325eed64241b36b5d4a
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 17 15:03:52 1999 +0000

    Samuel L. Bayer:
    
    - added -t and -a arguments
    - added "import wcnew; webchecker = wcnew" in place of "import
      webchecker" (I assume that if you're happy with the changes, you'll
      just replace webchecker.py with wcnew.py, but if I were to do that,
      the diffs would be incomprehensible)
    - fixed buggy -v argument (I think you got out of sync with the
      way verbosity was handled in webchecker vs. wcgui between 1.5 and
      1.5.2)
    - made -v actually do something by adding a call to c.setflags()
      (probably the same problem as above)
    - updated references to URLs to accommodate wcnew.py's pair
      representation; added appropriate calls to format_url() to handle
      display; added argument to ListPanel() initialization to provide
      access to format_url()
    
    [And untabified --GvR]

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 17 15:02:53 1999 +0000

    Samuel L. Bayer:
    
    - same fixes from webchecker.py
    - incorporated small diff between current webchecker.py and 1.5.2
    - fixed bug where "extra roots" added with the -t argument were being
      checked as real roots, not just as possible continuations
    - added -a argument to suppress checking of name anchors
    
    [And untabified --GvR]

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 17 15:00:14 1999 +0000

    Samuel L. Bayer:
    
    - forced new done origins to set errors if they're in self.bad (fixes
      bug where only the first of a number of errorful references to a
      link is reported under some circumstances)
    - suppressed adding duplicates to self.todo list (cleans up printout
      in wcgui details)

    \programopt:  New macro, used to mark command-line parameters in the
                  text.  Looks like \program.
    
    \citetitle:   New macro, used to mark titles of cited works (like the
                  names of the Python manuals).  Accepts & discards an
                  optional parameter that is only used by the HTML
                  formatter.  Looks like \emph.

    do_cmd_programopt():  New function, similar to do_cmd_program().
    
    do_cmd_citetitle():  New function.  Extracts one optional and one
                         required parameter.  If the optional one is
                         provided, it is used a URL (or relative URL) and
                         the text of the required parameter is turned into
                         a hyperlink.

    Patch by Dieter Maurer to make things work for Tcl/Tk 8.1.  This
    simply moves the call to Tk_MainWindow() after the Tcl/Tk
    initialization calls.  The patch is unconditional, it works with
    earlier and later versions as well.

    Patch by Dieter Maurer to make things work for Tcl/Tk 8.1 (tested with
    8.1.1).  His approach doesn't work with Tcl/Tk 8.2, so I've placed it
    inside #if TKMAJORMINOR == 8001 and #endif.  See also his patch for
    tkappinit.c.

    Several improvements, some of where were contributed by Bernhard
    Herzog <herzog@online.de>.  Specifically,
    
    --verbose/-v flag added
    
    pot_header added to make msgmerge and Emacs po-mode work better
    
    normalize(), escape(), safe_eval(): Improved normalization of strings
    for more .po file compatibility (e.g. C style).  Handles emmbedded
    newlines better.
    
    Also added an identity function called _() and use it in the file
    where messages are printed.  This allows us to selftest pygettext.py
    with itself as input.

    I regularly find that pdb sets the breakpoint on the wrong line when I
    try to set a breakpoint on a function.  This fixes the problem
    somewhat.
    The real problem is that pdb tries to parse the Python source code to
    find the first executable line.  A better way might be to inspect the
    code object, or even have a variable in the code object
    co_firstexecutablelineno, but that's too much work.
    
    The patch fixes the problem when the first code line after the def
    statement contains the start *and* end of a triple-quoted string.  The
    code assumed that the end of a triple-quoted string is not on the same
    line as the start, and so it would skip to the end of the *next*
    triple-quoted string.

    Oops.  spawnl() and spawnle() should be implemented on Windows too.
    
    Also added a comment that the 'p' variants (spawnvp() etc.) are *not*
    supported on Windows.  (They could be by adding them to posixmodule.c)

    Checking in a bunch of spawn functions.  These are only defined if we
    have fork and execv (and friends) but not spawnv.  They operate
    exactly like the spawn functions on Windows.  A limited set of needed
    constants is also defined (P_WAIT, P_NOWAIT etc.).
    
    Also add getenv() as a familiar alias for environ.get().

    Fix PR117.  The error message is "keywords must be strings".  Perhaps
    not as descriptive as what Barry suggests, but this also catches the
    (in my opinion important) case where some other C code besides apply()
    constructs a kwdict that doesn't have the right format.  All the other
    possibilities of getting it wrong (non-dict, wrong keywords etc) are
    already caught so this makes sense to check here.

    reformatted.)
    
    - Illegal padding is now ignored.  (Recommendation by GvR.)
    
    - Padding no longer removes characters from data string (resulting in
    lost data/strings with negative lengths).
    
    - Illegal characters outside the ASCII range are now ignored, instead
    of possibly being remapped to a valid character.

    Withdraw the change that Fred just checked in -- it was a poorly
    documented feature, not a bug, to ignore I/O errors in read().
    
    The new docstring explains the reason for the feature:
    """
    this is designed so that you can specifiy a list of potential
    configuration file locations (e.g. current directory, user's home
    directory, systemwide directory), and all existing configuration files
    in the list will be read.
    """
    
    Also add a lower-level function, readfp(), which takes an open file
    object (and optionally a filename).
    
    XXX There are some other problems with this module, but I don't have
    time to dig into these; in particular, there are complaints that the
    %(name)s substitution from the [DEFAULTS] section doesn't work
    correctly.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Oct 3 21:02:48 1999 +0000

    Added 'force' and 'quiet' (negative alias for 'verbose') to the
      global options table.
    Every Command instance now has its own copies of the global options,
      which automatically fallback to the Distribution instance.  Changes:
      - initialize them in constructor
      - added '__getattr__()' to handle the fallback logic
      - changed every 'self.distribution.{verbose,dry_run}' in Command to
        'self.{verbose,dry_run}'.
      - filesystem utility methods ('copy_file()' et al) don't take 'update'
        parameter anymore -- instead we pass 'not force' to the underlying
        function as 'update'
    Changed parsing of command line so that global options apply to all
      commands as well -- that's how (eg.) Command.verbose will be initialized.
    Simplified 'make_file()' to use 'newer_group()' (from util module).
    Deleted some cruft.
    Some docstring tweaks.

    Fixed 'mkpath()' to normalize the path right off the bat -- cleans up
      the code a bit and should make it work under Windows even with trailing
      backslash.
    Fixed a couple of docstrings.
    Added comment about 'make_file()' possibly being redundant and unnecessary.

    Catch up with changes in 'gen_lib_options()':
      - change how we call it
      - added methods 'library_dir_option()', 'library_option()', and
        'find_library_file()' that it calls
    Added 'force' flag; it's automatically "respected", because this class
      always rebuilds everything!  (Which it to say, "force=0" is not respected.)

    Fixed order of link options: object files now precede library stuff.
    Catch up with changes in 'gen_lib_options()':
      - change how we call it
      - added methods 'library_dir_option()', 'library_option()', and
        'find_library_file()' that it calls
    Added 'force' flag and changed compile/link methods to respect it.

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Sun Oct 3 20:41:02 1999 +0000

    Slight change to the meaning of the 'libraries' list: if a library name
      has a directory component, then we only search for the library in
      that one directory, ie. ignore the 'library_dirs' lists for that
      one library.
    Changed calling convention to 'gen_lib_options()' again: now, it takes
      a CCompiler instance and calls methods on it instead of taking
      format strings.  Also implemented the new "library name" semantics
      using the 'find_library_file()' method in the CCompiler instance.
    Added 'force' flag to CCompiler; added to constructor and 'new_compiler()'.
    Added 'warn()' method.

    Added 'package' option.
    Catch up with renamed 'platdir' -> 'build_platlib' option in 'build'.
    Don't call 'set_final_options()' in 'run()' anymore -- that's now
      guaranteed to be taken care of for us by the Distribution instance.
    If 'include_dirs' is a string, split it on os.pathsep (this is half-
      hearted -- support for setting compile/link options on the command
      line is totally lame and probably won't work at all).
    Added 'get_source_files()' for use by 'dist' command.
    Added code to 'build_extensions()' to figure out the "def file" to use
      with MSVC++ and add it to the linker command line as an "extra_postarg".

    Don't call 'set_final_options()' in 'run()' anymore -- that's now
      guaranteed to be taken care of for us by the Distribution instance.
    Rearranged to bit to allow outsiders (specifically, the 'dist' command)
      to find out what modules we would build:
      - 'find_modules()' renamed to 'find_package_modules()'
      - most of 'build_modules()' abstracted out to 'find_modules()'
      - added 'get_source_files()' (for the 'dist' command to use)
      - drastically simplified 'build_modules()' -- now just a wrapper around
        'find_modules()' and 'build_module()'

      - got rid of 'build_info' kludge parameter
      - added 'compiler_type' class attribute
      - respect reordered arguments to 'gen_lib_options()'
    Also added 'output_dir' parameter (catching up with older change in
      CCompiler) -- BUT this is presently ignored by all methods!
    Deleted some more docstrings redundant with CCompiler.
    Dropped generated of "/DEF:" argument --- that's now done by
      the 'build_ext' command.

    Added 'extra_preargs' and 'extra_postargs' parameters to most methods,
      which allowed us to get rid of the 'build_info' used in some places
      (a temporary kludge to support MSVC++ "def" files).
    Deleted big comment whining about that kludge.
    Added 'compiler_type' class attribute.
    Overhauled 'new_compiler()': now takes 'compiler' argument along with
      'plat' (both optional with sensible defaults), and looks them both up
      in the new 'default_compiler' and 'compiler_class' dictionaries to
      figure out where to get the concrete compiler class from.
    Reordered arguments to 'gen_lib_options()' to match the order in
      which the arguments are generated (ie. -L before -l).

    Added 'ready' flag and 'ensure_ready()' method to Command: together
      they make sure that 'set_final_options()' has been called, but isn't
      called redundantly.
    Changed Distribution to call 'ensure_ready()' where it used to call
      'set_final_options()', and in a few extra places as well.
    Lots of comment/docstring revisions and additions in both classes.
    New one-liner utility methods in Command: 'find_peer()', 'spawn()'.

Date:   Wed Sep 22 19:55:35 1999 +0000

    Added --image-type option to allow use of either GIF or PNG images.
    
    Job.warning():  New method; use this instead of writing to sys.stderr
                    directly.  Ensures warnings are also sent to the log
                    file.
    
    Job.log():  New method; write a message to the log file.  Use from
                .message() and .warning().

    Some updates to allow ../tools/mkhowto to add various bits to the
    supplemental l2h initialization file it creates and still get all the
    right behavior.  In particular, it can change the image type and icon
    location and not get inconsistent results.
    
    Some code to help suppress various navigational pages; this might be
    interesting when generating HTML to create HTML Help documents, since
    the navigation support creates confusing hits in the full text
    search.  HTML Help also provides a lot of the navigational
    infrastructure, so duplicating it makes it more tedious to use.

    main(): wrap the device.setinfo() call around an exception handler.
    It's possible to get a sunaudiodev.error (errno == EINVAL), although
    I'm not exactly sure why, this at least won't crash the application.

commit df0d33586d9c324cebb2193b8ccd0a6e30f7729c
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Tue Sep 21 18:41:36 1999 +0000

    Ditched the whole notion of "alias options": this meant dropping the
      'alias_options' table and getting rid of some hairy code in the
      Distribution constructor.
    Resurrected the distribution options that describe the modules present
      in the module distribution ('py_modules', 'ext_modules'), and added
      a bunch more: 'packages', 'package_dir', 'ext_package', 'include_dirs',
      'install_path'.
    Updated some comments.
    Added 'warn()' method to Command.
    'Command.get_command_name()' now stores generated command name in
      self.command_name.

    Added 'write_file()' function.
    Added global cache PATH_CREATED used by 'mkpath()' to ensure it doesn't
      try to create the same path more than once in a session (and, more
      importantly, to ensure that it doesn't print "creating X" more than
      once for each X per session!).

Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Tue Sep 21 18:31:14 1999 +0000

    Added 'install_path' option for giving non-packagized module
      distributions their own directory (and .pth file).
    Overhauled how we determine installation directories in
      'set_final_options()' to separate platform-dependence and take
      'install_path' option into account.
    Added 'create_path_file()' to create path config file when 'install_path'
      given.
    Only run 'install_py' and 'install_ext' when, respectively, there are
      some pure Python modules and some extension modules in the distribution.

    Some option changes:
      - rename 'dir' to 'build_dir'
      - take 'package' from distribution option 'ext_package'
      - take 'extensions' from distribution option 'ext_modules'
      - take 'include_dirs' from distribution
    Name keyword args explictly when calling CCompiler methods.
    Overhauled how we generate extension filenames (in 'extension_filename()
      and 'build_extension()') to take 'package' option into account.

    After much hemming and hawing, we decided to roll back Fred's change.
    It breaks Mailman, it was actually documented in the docstring, so it
    was an intentional deviation from the usual del semantics.  Let's

    must include net/netdb.h to get the inet_ntoa() and inet_addr()

    canonic(): This used to be equivalent to str() but that caused too
    much breakage (esp. in JPython which holds absolute path names in
    co_filename already).  This implementation uses os.path.abspath() as a
    slightly better way to canonicalize path names.  It implements a
    cache.

    Removed broken code that supports the __methods__ attribute on ast
    objects; the right magic was added to Py_FindMethod() since this was
    originally written.  <ast-object>.__methods__ now works, so dir() and
    rlcompleter are happy.

    call_trace(): A fix for PR#73, if an exception occurred in the

    Changed to reflect the new "command options" regime -- in particular,
    we no longer explicitly pull distribution options out of our Distribution
    object, but rather let the Distribution put them into the command object.

commit 42926ddc7e413f7f14ad68b75f7a6fffe9d96733
Author: Greg Ward <gward@python.net>
Date:   Wed Sep 8 02:41:09 1999 +0000

    Careful rethink of command options, distribution options, distribution
      attributes, etc.  Biggest change was to the Distribution constructor
      -- it now looks for an 'options' attribute, which contains values
      (options) that are explicitly farmed out to the commands.  Also,
      certain options supplied to Distribution (ie. in the 'setup()' call in
      setup.py) are now "command option aliases", meaning they are dropped
      right into a certain command rather than being distribution options.
      This is handled by a new Distribution class attribute,
      'alias_options'.
    Various comment changes to reflect the new way-of-thinking.
    Added 'get_command_name()' method to Command -- was assuming its
      existence all along as 'command_name()', so changed the code that
      needs it to call 'get_command_name()'.

    os.name is "posix" or "nt" or we don't care.
    Added big comment about the kludginess of passing 'build_options'
      to the link methods and how to fix it.
    Added 'gen_preprocess_options()' and 'gen_lib_options()' convenience

    recommended practice; I see no reason why making it the default
    behavior could be bad.)

    Added all the filename manglign methods: 'object_filenames()',
      'shared_object_filename()', 'library_filename()',
      'shared_library_filename()'.
    Added 'spawn()' method (front end to the "real" spawn).

    same directory as __file__, rather than searching for it along sys.path.
    This works better when idle is a package.

    Allow comment characters (#) to be escaped:
      - did away with 'comment_re' option -- it's just not that simple anymore
      - heavily revised the main logic in 'readline()' to accomodate this
    Beefed up 'warn()': 'line' can be list or tuple, and 'msg' is
      automatically converted to a string.

    paragraph detection & markup:  Handle some of the list-like

    bwrite(), ewrite():  Helpers for diagnostic output; essentially the
                    same as sys.stderr.write(), but bwrite() will make it
                    bold if stderr is a tty (for visibility).
    
                    Use these everywhere instead of accessing
                    sys.stderr.write() directly.
    
    find_all_child_elements():  Find all elements by type name that are
                    immediate children of another.
    
    cleanup_synopses():  Receive both the document and fragment objects as
                    parameters; if only the document is passed, synopsis
                    information is never found since it's in the fragment!
    
    build_para():   Add a chunk of code to ensure that a newline always
                    follows the </para> end-tag.  Not really important, but
                    makes presentation consistent for authoring/
                    maintenance.
    
    fixup_bifuncindexes_chunk(): Use find_all_child_elements() instead of
                    find_all_elements() so we don't work with too many
                    levels at once; that could cause DOM exceptions with
                    the <elem>.removeChild() method.

    Remove some redundant code from Canvas.tag_bind(), which added all
    bindings to a dictionary _tagcommands which was otherwise unused.
    (This was checked in accidentally with rev. 1.125 and not deleted with

    even as originally checked in the _tagcommands variable was never
    used.)

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 29 22:22:13 1999 +0000

    Massive changes.
    
    Separate the Conversion class into a base and a subclass; the subclass
    is pretty minimal but the separation is useful for....
    
    NewConversion:  New class that implements a somewhat different
                    approach to the conversion.  This uses a table of
                    instances (rather than tuples) that have more
                    information than the tuples used for the older
                    conversion procedure.  This allows a lot more control
                    over the conversion, and it seems to be pretty
                    stable.
    
    TableEntry,
    Parameter:      New classes that are used to build the conversion
                    specification used by NewConversion.
    
    TableParser:    xmllib.XMLParser subclass that builds a conversion
                    specification from an XML document.
    
    load_table():   Convenience function that loads a table from a file.
    
    main():  Added flags --new and --old; these select which conversion is
             used.  The default is --new.
    
    Several fixes have been made in the old conversion as well; these were
    done before writing & switching to the new conversion, and should be
    archived.
    
    The next checkin of this file will discard the old conversion; is is
    kept in this checkin to allow it to be retrieved if needed, and to
    avoid lossing the bugfixes that have been made to it in the interim.

    (python): Set defgroup :prefix to "py-" to make variable names cleaner.

    (python-mode): Set which interpreter (CPython or JPython) to use the
    first time a py buffer is visited during the Emacs session.  This
    ensures that py-which-shells is initialized and also guarantees that
    the mode lines reflect the correct shell.  First bug found by GvR,
    second one has long bugged :) me.
    
    (py-toggle-shells): Programmatically, arg can also take the symbols
    `cpython' or `jpython', which makes it easy to call with the value of
    py-default-interpreter.
    
    (py-shell): Don't need to initialize py-which-* variables since these
    will guarantee to be initialized by python-mode when the first py
    buffer is visited.
    
    (py-default-interpreter): Update docstring.

    It fixes a memory corruption error resulting from BadPickleGet
    exceptions in load_get, load_binget and load_long_binget.  This was
    initially reported on c.l.py as a problem with Cookie.py; see the thread
    titled "python core dump (SIGBUS) on Solaris" for more details.
    
    If PyDict_GetItem(self->memo, py_key) call failed, then py_key was being
    Py_DECREF'd out of existence before call was made to
    PyErr_SetObject(BadPickleGet, py_key).
    
    The bug can be duplicated as follows:
    
    import cPickle
    cPickle.loads('garyp')
    
    This raises a BadPickleGet exception whose value is a freed object.  A
    core dump will soon follow.

    Milton L. Hankin reports that on Windows it is possible to have two
    different values in the environ dict with the same key (although he
    couldn't explain exactly how this came to be).  Since getenv() uses
    the first one, Python should do too. (Some doubts about case
    sensitivity, but for now this at least seems the right thing to do
    regardless of platform.)

    Add _close() method that does the actual cleanup (close() asks the
    user what they want first if there's unsaved stuff, and may cancel).
    It closes more than before.
    
    Add unload_extensions() method to unload all extensions; called from
    _close().  It calls an extension's close() method if it has one.

    Clarify the example by explicitly importing the fcntl module -- this
    avoid being fooled into thinking that fcntl and FCNTL are the same
    thing -- they aren't!  (fcntl is the extension, FCNTL.py is h2py
    output that defines all the constants).
    
    (XXX The example is still weird -- I think there's a more portable way
    to do locking now.  That's for someone else to fix...)

    Urllib makes the URL of the opened file available through the geturl
    method of the returned object.  For local files, this consists of
    file: plus the name of the file.  This results in an invalid URL if
    the file name was relative.  This patch fixes this so that the
    returned URL is just a relative URL in that case.  When the file name
    is absolute, the URL returned is of the form file:///absolute/path.
    
    [I guess that a URL of the form "file:foo.html" is illegal...  GvR]

    Simplified version of a patch by Chih-Hao Huang, who wrote:
    
    """
    When there are additional Setup files, specified by -e option of freeze,
    checkextenstions.py assumes that *.o, *.a, -Lpath, and -Rpath are all
    relative to where the Setup file is. select() inserts the path to the
    Setup file to make them absolute. However, the assumption is not true.
    There are cases that absolute paths are specified for them. The inserted
    prefix, by select(), results in error.
    
    The following fix check for absolute paths. The assumption is: an
    absolute path begins with either '/' or '$'. In the latter case, it is
    from the environmental variable. (Variables defined locally in the Setup
    file have already been handled by expandvars())
    """
    
    My version of the patch has been verified by Charles Waldman (a
    colleague of Chih-Hao).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Jun 22 14:47:32 1999 +0000

    Patch by Tim Peters:
    
    Introduce a new builtin exception, UnboundLocalError, raised when ceval.c
    tries to retrieve or delete a local name that isn't bound to a value.
    Currently raises NameError, which makes this behavior a FAQ since the same
    error is raised for "missing" global names too:  when the user has a global
    of the same name as the unbound local, NameError makes no sense to them.
    Even in the absence of shadowing, knowing whether a bogus name is local or
    global is a real aid to quick understanding.
    
    Example:
    
    D:\src\PCbuild>type local.py
    x = 42
    
    def f():
        print x
        x = 13
        return x
    
    f()
    
    D:\src\PCbuild>python local.py
    Traceback (innermost last):
      File "local.py", line 8, in ?
        f()
      File "local.py", line 4, in f
        print x
    UnboundLocalError: x
    
    D:\src\PCbuild>
    
    Note that UnboundLocalError is a subclass of NameError, for compatibility
    with existing class-exception code that may be trying to catch this as a
    NameError.  Unfortunately, I see no way to make this wholly compatible
    with -X (see comments in bltinmodule.c):  under -X, [UnboundLocalError
    is an alias for NameError --GvR].
    
    [The ceval.c patch differs slightly from the second version that Tim
    submitted; I decided not to raise UnboundLocalError for DELETE_NAME,
    only for DELETE_LOCAL.  DELETE_NAME is only generated at the module
    level, and since at that level a NameError is raised for referencing
    an undefined name, it should also be raised for deleting one.]

    winmakemakefile.py tries to allow for spaces in the python install

    the path.
    
    Microsoft's NMAKE version 6.0 is happy with this (!!!!)  unless there
    is also a space in the name. I guess most users of freeze on windows
    do not use the same path as the binary distribution.
    
    I've tested the following changes on systems with and without a space
    in the path.

commit 1d5ad90c1c13c8310c159b788f9c2227b635aabc
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 18 14:22:24 1999 +0000

    CRITICAL PATCH!
    
    We occasionally received reports from people getting "invalid tstate"
    crashes (this is a fatal error in PyThreadState_Delete()).  Finally
    several people were able to reproduce it reliably and Tim Peters
    discovered that there is a race condition when multiple threads are
    calling this function without holding the global interpreter lock (the
    function may be called without holding that).
    
    Solved the race condition by adding a lock around the mutating uses of
    interp->tstate_head.  Tim and Jonathan Giddy have run tests that make
    it likely that this fixes the crashes -- although Tim hasn't heard
    from the person who reported the original problem.

    Patch suggested (and partially provided) by Lars Damerow: instead of
    always lowercasing the option name, call a method optionxform() which
    can be overridden.  Also make the regexps SECTRE and OPTRE non-private
    variables so they can also be overridden.

             use 'rb'.

Date:   Wed Jun 16 17:28:37 1999 +0000

    Patch by Jim Fulton (code style tweaked a bit) to support
    ExtensionClasses in isinstance() and issubclass().
    
      - abstract instance and class protocols are used *only* in those
        cases that would generate errors before the patch.  That is, there's
        no penalty for the normal case.
    
      - instance protocol: an object smells like an instance if it
        has a __class__ attribute that smells like a class.
    
      - class protocol: an object smells like a class if it has a
        __bases__ attribute that is a tuple with elements that
        smell like classes (although not all elements may actually get
        sniffed ;).

    The fix is to preserve the quotes around a local-part

    Test:

    Tim Peters smart.patch:
    
    EditorWindow.py:
    
    + Added get_tabwidth & set_tabwidth "virtual text" methods, that get/set the
    widget's view of what a tab means.
    
    + Moved TK_TABWIDTH_DEFAULT here from AutoIndent.
    
    + Renamed Mark's get_selection_index to get_selection_indices (sorry, Mark,
    but the name was plain wrong <wink>).
    
    FormatParagraph.py:  renamed use of get_selection_index.
    
    AutoIndent.py:
    
    + Moved TK_TABWIDTH_DEFAULT to EditorWindow.
    
    + Rewrote set_indentation_params to use new VTW get/set_tabwidth methods.
    
    + Changed smart_backspace_event to delete whitespace back to closest
    preceding virtual tab stop or real character (note that this may require
    inserting characters if backspacing over a tab!).
    
    + Nuked almost references to the selection tag, in favor of using
    get_selection_indices.  The sole exception is in set_region, for which no
    "set_selection" abstraction has yet been agreed upon.
    
    + Had too much fun using the spiffy new features of the format-paragraph
    cmd.

    Co-production with Tim Peters, implementing a suggestion by Mark
    Hammond: record top-level functions (as Function instances, a simple
    subclass of Class).  You must use the new interface readmodule_ex() to
    get these, though.

    Fix by Sjoerd for a package related bug: If you have a non-empy
    __init__.py it isn't read.  (Sjoerd just came up with this, so it's
    not heavily tested.)
    
    Other (yet unsolved) package problems noted by Sjoerd:
    
    - If you have a package and a module inside that or another package
      with the same name, module caching doesn't work properly since the
      key is the base name of the module/package.
    - The only entry that is returned when you readmodule a package is a
      __path__ whose value is a list which confuses certain class browsers
      that I wrote.  (Hm, this could be construed as a feature.)

    I guess in 1.5.2 a new module, whichdb, was added that attempts to
    divine the nature of a database file.  This module doesn't know anything
    about Berkeley DB v2 files.  In v2, Sleepycat added a 12-byte null pad
    in front of the old magic numbers (at least for hash and btree files).
    I've been using v2 for awhile and upgrading to 1.5.2 broke all my

    + Set usetabs=1.  Editing pyclbr.py was driving me nuts <0.6 wink>.
    usetabs=1 is the Emacs pymode default too, and thanks to indentwidth !=
    tabwidth magical usetabs disabling, new files are still created with tabs
    turned off.  The only implication is that if you open a file whose first
    indent is a single tab, IDLE will now magically use tabs for that file (and
    set indentwidth to 8).  Note that the whole scheme doesn't work right for
    PythonWin, though, since Windows users typically set tabwidth to 4; Mark
    probably has to hide the IDLE algorithm from them (which he already knows).
    
    + Changed comment_region_event to stick "##" in front of every line.  The
    "holes" previously left on blank lines were visually confusing (made it

    longer missing methods in PyShell.py; etc.  Also captures defs
    starting in column 1 now, but ignores them; an interface should be
    added so that IDLE's class browser can show the top-level functions
    too.

    Experimental speedup patch by Tim Peters (please test!):
    
    It wasn't hard to speed pyclbr by a factor of 3, and I'll attach an
    experimental patch for that (experimental because barely tested).  Uncomment
    the new "String" stuff and it will deal with strings correctly (pyclbr
    currently ignores the possibility), but that slows it down a lot.  Still
    faster in the end than current pyclbr, but-- frankly --I'd rather have the
    dramatic speedup!

    Fix bug discovered by John W. Shipman -- when the width of a format
    specifier came from an int expression instead of a constant in the
    format, a negative width was truncated to zero instead of taken to
    mean the same as that negative constant plugged into the format.  E.g.
    "(%*s)" % (-5, "foo") yielded "(foo)" while "(%-5s)" yields "(foo  )".
    Now both yield the latter -- like sprintf() in C.

    Speeds terrible cases by at least a factor of 10. "Terrible" == e.g. you put
    """ at the start of Tkinter.py, undo it, zoom to the bottom, and start
    typing in code.  Used to take about 8 seconds for ENTER to respond, now some
    large fraction of a second.  The new code gets indented correctly, despite
    that it all remains "string colored" until the colorizer catches up (after
    which, ENTER appears instantaneous again).

    whatever it is you pass as editwin to AutoIndent; looking at the
    EditorWindow.py part of the patch should make this clear.

    Unix bindings for <<toggle-tabs>> and <<change-indentwidth>> were

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

    Tim Peters again:
    
    The new version (attached) is fast enough all the time in every real module
    I have <whew!>.  You can make it slow by, e.g., creating an open list with
    5,000 90-character identifiers (+ trailing comma) each on its own line, then
    adding an item to the end -- but that still consumes less than a second on
    my P5-166.  Response time in real code appears instantaneous.
    
    Fixed some bugs.
    
    New feature:  when hitting ENTER and the cursor is beyond the line's leading
    indentation, whitespace is removed on both sides of the cursor; before
    whitespace was removed only on the left; e.g., assuming the cursor is
    between the comma and the space:
    
    def something(arg1, arg2):
                       ^ cursor to the left of here, and hit ENTER
                   arg2):   # new line used to end up here
                  arg2):    # but now lines up the way you expect
    
    New hack:  AutoIndent has grown a context_use_ps1 Boolean config option,
    defaulting to 0 (false) and set to 1 (only) by PyShell.  Reason:  handling
    the fancy stuff requires looking backward for a parsing synch point; ps1
    lines are the only sensible thing to look for in a shell window, but are a
    bad thing to look for in a file window (ps1 lines show up in my module
    docstrings often).  PythonWin's shell should set this true too.
    
    Persistent problem:  strings containing def/class can still screw things up
    completely.  No improvement.  Simplest workaround is on the user's head, and
    consists of inserting e.g.
    
    def _(): pass
    
    (or any other def/class) after the end of the multiline string that's
    screwing them up.  This is especially irksome because IDLE's syntax coloring
    is *not* confused, so when this happens the colors don't match the
    indentation behavior they see.

    [Tim, after adding some bracket smarts to AutoIndent.py]
    > ...

    The attached can, and actually fast enough to use -- most of the time.  The
    code is tricky beyond belief to achieve that, but it works so far; e.g.,
    
            return len(string.expandtabs(str[self.stmt_start :
                                             ^ indents to caret
                                             i],
                                         ^ indents to caret
                                         self.tabwidth)) + 1
        ^ indents to caret
    
    It's about as smart as pymode now, wrt both bracket and backslash
    continuation rules.  It does require reparsing large gobs of text, and if it
    happens to find something that looks like a "def" or "class" or sys.ps1
    buried in a multiline string, but didn't suck up enough preceding text to
    see the start of the string, it's completely hosed.  I can't repair that --
    it's just too slow to reparse from the start of the file all the time.
    
    AutoIndent has grown a new num_context_lines tuple attribute that controls
    how far to look back, and-- like other params --this could/should be made
    user-overridable at startup and per-file on the fly.

    Tim Peters keeps revising this module (more to come):
    
    Removed "New tabwidth" menu binding.
    
    Added "a tab means how many spaces?" dialog to block tabify and untabify.  I
    think prompting for this is good now:  they're usually at-most-once-per-file
    commands, and IDLE can't let them change tabwidth from the Tk default
    anymore, so IDLE can no longer presume to have any idea what a tab means.
    
    Irony:  for the purpose of keeping comments aligned via tabs, Tk's
    non-default approach is much nicer than the Emacs/Notepad/Codewright/vi/etc
    approach.

                              called on destruction is non-NULL.

    make_index_entry():  Remove.  Not only did this override the
                         l2hinit.perl version of the function (which
                         overrode a version in latex2html), but
                         do_cmd_index() was overridden.  Since
                         do_cmd_index() was the only caller, we can trash
                         this.
    
    define_indexing_macro():  New function used during setup to support
                              more dynamic dispatch for indexing.
    
    process_index_macros():  New function; implement dynamic dispatching
                             of indexing support functions, allowing many
                             targets used in indexing to be shared by
                             multiple index entries.  I.e., something like
                             \index{foo}\bifuncindex{bar} can now share a
                             single target anchor.
    
    These indexing changes reduce the amount of clutter in the generated
    HTML files.  In the reference manual, this cuts the number of targets
    by 44%.  Targets are less affected when generated by environments
    rather than macros.

    make_index_entry():  Remove.  This is overridden in python.perl and
                         was never called in this incarnation.  The

    Give the attached a whirl.  Even if you hate the implementation, I think

    The 'copy_file()' and 'copy_tree()' functions in util.py now have
    meaningful return values: respectively, whether the copy was done, and
    the list of files that were copied.  This meant some trivial changes in
    core.py as well: the Command methods that mirror 'copy_file()' and
    'copy_tree()' have to pass on their return values.

    Rearranged things so that compilation of .py files is the responsibility
    of the 'install_py' command rather than 'build_py'.  Obviously, this
    meant that the 'build_py' and 'install_py' modules had to change; less
    obviously, so did 'install' and 'build', since these higher-level
    commands must make options available to control the lower-level
    commands, and some compilation-related options had to migrate with the
    code.

    do_cmd_seetext():  Clean up so we get proper nesting of <div>s.  This
                       fixes a rendering problem on IE5.
    
    General adjustments to the table* environments, including using
    <thead> and <tbody>.  Attempt to adjust the vertical alignment of the
    table cells so that the baseline of the first cell matches the
    baseline of the remaining cells:  When the first cell is small and the
    second cell of the same row is multi-line, the first cell was
    vertically centered by default.  Specifying valign=baseline fixes the
    problem on IE, but Netscape seems to ignore both valign=top and
    valign=baseline (even though valign is NS's fault!).  Make the
    horizontal alignment of 'p' columns left instead of center (for the
    headings).

    (2) Add cookie support, by placing the 'Cookie:' header, if present,
    in the HTTP_COOKIE environment variable.

    Lots of changes to support loading alternative color name database.
    You can switch database by just loading the new one; the list window
    and nearest colors adapt to the new database.
    
    Some reorganizing of code.  Also, the name of the database file is
    stored in the ~/.pynche pickle.  If it can't be loaded, fallbacks are
    used.

    Tim Peters strikes again:
    
    Ho ho ho -- that's trickier than it sounded!  The colorizer is working with
    "line.col" strings instead of Text marks, and the absolute coordinates of
    the point of interest can change across the self.update call (voice of
    baffled experience, when two quick backspaces no longer fooled it, but a
    backspace followed by a quick ENTER did <wink>).
    
    Anyway, the attached appears to do the trick.  CPU usage goes way up when
    typing quickly into a long triple-quoted string, but the latency is fine for
    me (a relatively fast typist on a relatively slow machine).  Most of the
    changes here are left over from reducing the # of vrbl names to help me
    reason about the logic better; I hope the code is a *little* easier to

    The test really wanted to distinguish between the two.  So now we test

    I have an email from Christian Tanzer confirming that it works for
    libc5, so it should be fine.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 22 22:27:40 1999 +0000

    Mostly rewritten.  Instead of the old Run module and Debug module,
    there are two new commands:
    
    Import module (F5) imports or reloads the module and also adds its
    name to the __main__ namespace.  This gets executed in the PyShell
    window under control of its debug settings.
    
    Run script (Control-F5) is similar but executes the contents of the
    file directly in the __main__ namespace.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 22 20:49:35 1999 +0000

    A lot of changes to make the command line more useful.  You can now do:
      idle.py -e file ...    -- to edit files
      idle.py script arg ... -- to run a script
      idle.py -c cmd arg ... -- to run a command
    Other options, see also the usage message (also new!) for more details:
      -d       -- enable debugger
      -s       -- run $IDLESTARTUP or $PYTHONSTARTUP
      -t title -- set Python Shell window's title
    sys.argv is set accordingly, unless -e is used.
    sys.path is absolutized, and all relevant paths are inserted into it.
    
    Other changes:
    - the environment in which commands are executed is now the __main__ module
    - explicitly save sys.stdout etc., don't restore from sys.__stdout__
    - new interpreter methods execsource(), execfile(), stuffsource()
    - a few small nits

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 22 15:19:01 1999 +0000

    Don't describe this module as being a popen() wrapper; that's a little
    confusing.  This is clearly Unix-specific; label it as such.

    Don't refer to the system documentation as "man pages"; too
    Unix-centric.  Note that this can be used with the output of
    os.fstat() as well as os.stat() and os.lstat().

    Some more TODO items.  Made up my mind about command line args,
    Run/Import, __main__.

    Add warning that last() and previous() don't work for hashtable
    databases (opened using hashopen()), as noted by Skip Montanaro on
    comp.lang.python.

commit e62e76c38322ebb88bcf54a933a07291d9e7c5ba
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 22 13:38:40 1999 +0000

    Super-elegant patch by Tim Peters that speeds up colorization
    dramatically (up to 15 times he claims).  Works by reading more than
    one line at a time, up to 100-line chunks (starting with one line and
    then doubling up to the limit).  On a typical machine (e.g. Tim's
    P5-166) this doesn't reduce interactive responsiveness in a noticeable
    way.

commit 693a2c65812eb61a87cacf1a23b83db35bbf9552
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 22 13:08:09 1999 +0000

    Script to locate uses of \module where the module referred to is not
    the module being documented at that point in the documentation; these
    are candidates for conversion to \refmodule, which produces a
    hyperlink in the HTML and PDF versions of the output.

commit e0208cc83cbc91bca0eb802b540c45a430399ef5
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 22 13:05:27 1999 +0000

    Fill in a lot of the blanks.  Add a start to the LaTeX primer section.
    
    Use Python-traditional XXX comments instead of square brackets that
    aren't as obvious or usefully grepable.

commit 30a535c0f75ca4068d489e623d8d3893df9409cc
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 22 13:03:49 1999 +0000

    Added support for adding environment/macro parameters more cleanly:
    \op adds an optional parameter, and \p adds a required parameter.
    These are only defined in the context of the parameter list parameter
    of the envdesc and macrodesc environments.

Date:   Wed Apr 21 16:52:20 1999 +0000

    Patch by Per Cederqvist, seemingly approved by The Dragon:
    
    Two problems: The SMTPRecipientsRefused class should not inherit
    SMTPResponseException, since it doesn't provide the smtp_code and
    smtp_error attributes.  My patch for not adding an extra CRLF was
    apparently forgotten.  The enclosed patch fixes these two problems.

    Patch by Mark Favas: it fixes the search engine behaviour where an
    unsuccessful search wraps around and re-searches that part of the file
    between the start of the search and the end of the file - only really
    an issue for very large files, but... (also removes a redundant
    m.span() call).

    Calling _cleanup() does not guarantee that all processes have
    terminated; this makes the final assert in the self-test code fail if
    the parent runs faster than the children.  Fix this by calling wait()
    on the remaining children instead.

    Jim Fulton writes:
    
    I have attached a new cPickle that adds a new control attribute
    to unpicklers:
    
      Added new Unpickler attribute, find_global.  If set to None, then
      global and instance pickles are disabled.  Otherwise, it should be set to
      a callable object that takes two arguments, a module name and an
      object name, and returns an object.  If the attribute is unset, then
      the default mechanism is used.
    
      This feature provides an additional mechanism for controlling which
      classes can be used for unpickling.

    A few wishes are now fulfilled.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Apr 19 16:23:15 1999 +0000

    Tim Peters implements some of my wishes:
    
    o Makes the tab key intelligently insert spaces when appropriate (see Help
    list banter twixt David Ascher and me; idea stolen from every other editor
    on earth <wink>).
    
    o newline_and_indent_event trims trailing whitespace on the old line (pymode
    and Codewright).
    
    o newline_and_indent_event no longer fooled by trailing whitespace or
    comment after ":" (pymode, PTUI).
    
    o newline_and_indent_event now reduces the new line's indentation after
    return, break, continue, raise and pass stmts (pymode).
    
    The last two are easy to fool in the presence of strings & continuations,
    but pymode requires Emacs's high-powered C parsing functions to avoid that
    in finite time.

    While I can't really test this thoroughly, Pat Knight and the Solaris
    man pages suggest that the proper thing to do is to add THR_NEW_LWP to
    the flags on thr_create(), and that there really isn't a downside, so
    I'll do that.

    Bump the myusterious M$ version number from 1,5,2,1 to 1,5,2,3.
    (I can't even display this on NT, maybe Win/98 can?)

    Fix mysterious references to jprofile that were in the source since
    its creation.  I'm assuming these were once valid references to "Jim
    Roskind's profile"...

Date:   Tue Apr 13 04:07:32 1999 +0000

    Put back __osf__ support for gethostbyname_r(); the real bug was that
    it was being used even without threads.  This of course might be an
    all-platform problem so now we only use the _r variant when we are
    using threads.

    Tamito Kajiyama.  (This caused a bug only on platforms where malloc(0)

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Apr 12 14:34:16 1999 +0000

    Two different changes.
    
    1. Jack Jansen reports that on the Mac, the time may be negative, and
    solves this by adding a write32u() function that writes an unsigned
    long.
    
    2. On 64-bit platforms the CRC comparison fails; I've fixed this by
    casting both values to be compared to "unsigned long" i.e. modulo
    0x100000000L.

    On Windows, we suddenly find, strftime() may return "" for an
    unsupported format string.  (I guess this is because the logic for
    deciding whether to reallocate the buffer or not has been improved.)
    This caused the test code to crash on result[0].  Fix this by assuming
    an empty result also means the format is not supported.

    Delete an accidentally checked-in feature that actually broke more
    than was worth it: when deleting a canvas item, it would try to
    automatically delete the bindings for that item.  Since there's
    nothing that says you can't reuse the tag and still have the bindings,
    this is not correct.  Also, it broke at least one demo
    (Demo/tkinter/matt/rubber-band-box-demo-1.py).

    Patch by Andrew Kuchling to unflush() (flush() for deflating).

    Changes by Per Cederquist and The Dragon.
    
    Per writes:
    
    """
    The application where Signum Support uses smtplib needs to be able to
    report good error messages to the user when sending email fails.  To
    help in diagnosing problems it is useful to be able to report the
    entire message sent by the server, not only the SMTP error code of the
    offending command.
    
    A lot of the functions in sendmail.py unfortunately discards the
    message, leaving only the code.  The enclosed patch fixes that
    problem.
    
    The enclosed patch also introduces a base class for exceptions that
    include an SMTP error code and error message, and make the code and
    message available on separate attributes, so that surrounding code can
    deal with them in whatever way it sees fit.  I've also added some
    documentation to the exception classes.
    
    The constructor will now raise an exception if it cannot connect to
    the SMTP server.
    
    The data() method will raise an SMTPDataError if it doesn't receive
    the expected 354 code in the middle of the exchange.
    
    According to section 5.2.10 of RFC 1123 a smtp client must accept "any
    text, including no text at all" after the error code.  If the response
    of a HELO command contains no text self.helo_resp will be set to the
    empty string ("").  The patch fixes the test in the sendmail() method
    so that helo_resp is tested against None; if it has the empty string
    as value the sendmail() method would invoke the helo() method again.
    
    The code no longer accepts a -1 reply from the ehlo() method in
    sendmail().
    
    [Text about removing SMTPRecipientsRefused deleted --GvR]
    """
    
    and also:
    
    """
    smtplib.py appends an extra blank line to the outgoing mail if the
    `msg' argument to the sendmail method already contains a trailing
    newline.  This patch should fix the problem.
    """
    
    The Dragon writes:
    
    """
            Mostly I just re-added the SMTPRecipientsRefused exception
    (the exeption object now has the appropriate info in it ) [Per had
    removed this in his patch --GvR] and tweaked the behavior of the
    sendmail method whence it throws the newly added SMTPHeloException (it
    was closing the connection, which it shouldn't.  whatever catches the
    exception should do that. )
    
            I pondered the change of the return values to tuples all around,
    and after some thinking I decided that regularizing the return values was
    too much of the Right Thing (tm) to not do.
    
            My one concern is that code expecting an integer & getting a tuple
    may fail silently.
    
    (i.e. if it's doing :
    
          x.somemethod() >= 400:

            However, most smtplib code I've seen only really uses the
    sendmail() method, so this wouldn't bother it.  Usually code I've seen
    that calls the other methods usually only calls helo() and ehlo() for
    doing ESMTP, a feature which was not in the smtplib included with 1.5.1,
    and thus I would think not much code uses it yet.

    Fix the tests now that splitdrive() no longer treats UNC paths special.
    (Some tests converted to splitunc() tests.)

commit f3c695c4675e61d5c303c96db699184253810306
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Apr 6 19:32:19 1999 +0000

    Withdraw the UNC support from splitdrive().  Instead, a new function
    splitunc() parses UNC paths.  The contributor of the UNC parsing in
    splitdrive() doesn't like it, but I haven't heard a good reason to
    keep it, and it causes some problems.  (I think there's a
    philosophical problem -- to me, the split*() functions are purely
    syntactical, and the fact that \\foo is not a valid path doesn't mean
    that it shouldn't be considered an absolute path.)
    
    Also (quite separately, but strangely related to the philosophical
    issue above) fix abspath() so that if win32api exists, it doesn't fail
    when the path doesn't actually exist -- if GetFullPathName() fails,
    fall back on the old strategy (join with getcwd() if neccessary, and
    then use normpath()).

    Based on a suggestion from bruce@hams.com, make a trivial change to
    allow using the 'a' flag as a mode for opening a GzipFile.  gzip
    files, surprisingly enough, can be concatenated and then decompressed;
    the effect is to concatenate the two chunks of data.
    
    If we support it on writing, it should also be supported on reading.
    This *wasn't* trivial, and required rearranging the code in the
    reading path, particularly the _read() method.
    
    Raise IOError instead of RuntimeError in two cases, 'Not a gzipped file'
    and 'Unknown compression method'

    Added Samuel Bayer's new webchecker.
    Unfortunately his code breaks wcgui.py in a way that's not easy
    to fix.  I expect that this is a temporary situation --
    eventually Sam's changes will be merged back in.
    (The changes add a -t option to specify exceptions to the -x
    option, and explicit checking for #foo style fragment ids.)

    Implement two suggestions by Jonathan Giddy: (1) in AIX, clear the
    data struct before calling gethostby{name,addr}_r(); (2) ignore the
    3/5/6 args determinations made by the configure script and switch on
    platform identifiers instead:
    
    AIX, OSF have 3 args
    Sun, SGI have 5 args
    Linux has 6 args
    
    On all other platforms, undef HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R altogether.

    Clean up pass for the previous patches.
    
    - Use HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R_6_ARG instead of testing for Linux and
    glibc2.
    
    - If gethostbyname takes 3 args, undefine HAVE_GETHOSTBYNAME_R --
    don't know what code should be used.
    
    - New symbol USE_GETHOSTBYNAME_LOCK defined iff the lock should be used.
    
    - Modify the gethostbyaddr() code to also hold on to the lock until
    after it is safe to release, overlapping with the Python lock.
    
    (Note: I think that it could in theory be possible that Python code
    executed while gethostbyname_lock is held could attempt to reacquire
    the lock -- e.g. in a signal handler or destructor.  I will simply say
    "don't do that then.")

    Here's a patch to fix the race condition, which wasn't fixed by Rob's
    patch.  It holds the gethostbyname lock until the results are copied out,
    which means that this lock and the Python global lock are held at the same
    time.  This shouldn't be a problem as long as the gethostbyname lock is
    always acquired when the global lock is not held.

    Revise the verbatim environment: simple implementation, but more
    compatible if a document also add \usepackage{verbatim} at the
    beginning.
    
    Declare \modindex, \bimodindex, \exmodindex, and \stmodindex
    obsolete.  These still work just fine, but \declaremodule should be
    used instead.  The obsolete macros will print a warning on standard

    Delete non-standard-conforming code in urljoin() that would use the
    netloc from the base url as the default netloc for the resulting url
    even if the schemes differ.
    
    Once upon a time, when the web was wild, this was a valuable hack
    because some people had a URL referencing an ftp server colocated with
    an http server without having the host in the ftp URL (so they could
    replicate it or change the hostname easily).
    
    More recently, after the file: scheme got added back to the list of
    schemes that accept a netloc, it turns out that this caused weirdness
    when joining an http: URL with a file: URL -- the resulting file: URL
    would always inherit the host from the http: URL because the file:
    scheme supports a netloc but in practice never has one.
    
    There are two reasons to get rid of the old, once-valuable hack,
    instead of removing the file: scheme from the uses_netloc list.  One,
    the RFC says that file: uses the netloc syntax, and does not endorse
    the old hack.  Two, neither netscape 4.5 nor IE 4.0 support the old
    hack.

    An attempt to execute grid_slaves with arguments (0,0) results in
    *all* of the slaves being returned, not just the slave associated with
    row 0, column 0.  This is because the test for arguments in the method
    does not test to see if row (and column) does not equal None, but
    rather just whether is evaluates to non-false.  A value of 0 fails
    this test.

    Vladimir has restructured his code somewhat so that the blocks are now
    represented by an explicit structure.  (There are still too many casts
    in the code, but that may be unavoidable.)

    - Don't crash in the case where a superclass is a string instead of a
    pyclbr.Class object; this can happen when the superclass is
    unrecognizable (to pyclbr), e.g. when module renaming is used.
    
    - Show a watch cursor when calling pyclbr (since it may take a while
    recursively parsing imported modules!).

    "Path browser" - 4 scrolled lists displaying:
        directories on sys.path
        modules in selected directory
        classes in selected module
        methods of selected class
    
    Sinlge clicking in a directory, module or class item updates the next
    column with info about the selected item.  Double clicking in a
    module, class or method item opens the file (and selects the clicked
    item if it is a class or method).
    
    I guess eventually I should be using a tree widget for this, but the
    ones I've seen don't work well enough, so for now I use the old
    Smalltalk or NeXT style multi-column hierarchical browser.

    Switch to the Python version of mkhowto.

commit 8b88093b959fb7f1cd570c4334d95ad9fe7953f3
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 3 20:24:30 1999 +0000

    Re-written mkhowto in Python; this should be at least a little more
    portable.
    
    Several things that had been done by running a python script are now a
    matter of importing the right module and running a function with a few
    parameters.

    process():  New function that contains the "orchestration" of the
                actual work.
    
    main():  Just handle the command line and filename determination,
             calling process() to do the work.
    
    These changes make this more import-friendly.

    Be a little more friendly for the generation of the text version: for
    "blank" navigation icons, use ALT="" instead of ALT="blank"; also add
    ALIGN=CENTER for the table, to get a slightly better affect in the
    text (the table is full-width, so this doesn't change the appearance
    when browsing the HTML).

    do_cmd_ignorePlatformAnnotation(),
    do_cmd_platform(),
    do_cmd_platformof():  New functions to support platform dependency
                          information.
    
    process_all_platformofs():  New function to post-process \platformof macros
            using information collected during the initial pass.
    
    process_python_state():  New function. Call all post-processing functions

            the internals for this stuff in l2hinit.perl.

    When performing a POST request, i.e. when the second argument to
    urlopen is used to specify form data, make sure the second argument is
    threaded through all of the http_error_NNN calls.  This allows error
    handlers like the redirect and authorization handlers to properly
    re-start the connection.

    Patch by Lars Wirzenius:
    
            o the initial comment is wrong: creating messages is already
              implemented
    
            o Message.getbodytext: if the mail or it's part contains an
              empty content-transfer-encoding header, the code used to
              break; the change below treats an empty encoding value the same
              as the other types that do not need decoding
    
            o SubMessage.getbodytext was missing the decode argument; the
              change below adds it; I also made it unconditionally return
              the raw text if decoding was not desired, because my own
              routines needed that (and it was easier than rewriting my
              own routines ;-)

    (initerrors): Make sure that the exception tuples ("base-classes" when
    string-based exceptions are used) reflect the real class hierarchy,
    i.e. that SystemExit derives from Exception not StandardError.

    Patch by Tim Peters to improve the range checks for range() and
    xrange(), especially for platforms where int and long are different
    sizes (so sys.maxint isn't actually the theoretical limit for the
    length of a list, but the largest C int is -- sys.maxint is the
    largest Python int, which is actually a C long).

    Patch by Tadayoshi Funaba (with some changes) to be smarter about
    guessing what happened when strftime() returns 0.  Is it buffer
    overflow or was the result simply 0 bytes long?  (This happens for an
    empty format string, or when the format string is a single %Z and the
    timezone is unknown.)  if the buffer is at least 256 times as long as
    the format, assume the latter.

    In atoi(), don't use isxdigit() to test whether the last character
    converted was a "digit" -- use isalnum().  This test is there only to
    guard against "+" or "-" being interpreted as a valid int literal.
    Reported by Takahiro Nakayama.

    When there's not a usable .aux file, use mkdvi.sh --aux instead of

    Make table headers the same color as the navigation bars so they stand
    out a little better.
    
    Make sure the boxes for the last column of tables always get drawn;
    these are often left empty of content when used as a "Notes" column.
    They look a little better this way.

    Got rid of the file-global PosixError.  This was redundant since it
    was just an alias for PyExc_OSError and the way we were doing it was
    causing a (small) memory leak anyway.  Just use PyExc_OSError
    everywhere.

    On Windows, -i shouldn't call set[v]buf(stdin, ...) because it screws
    up the _tkinter main loop.  Not clear why; the _kbhit() call _tkinter
    makes probably confuses the stdio library when buffering isn't set to
    whatever it is by default.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 8 18:34:01 1999 +0000

    Tim Peters:
    
    + Implements a put_nowait method.
    + Adds a corresponding Queue.Full exception.
    + Simplifies the implementation by adding optional "block" args to get() and
    put(), and makes the old get_nowait() and new put_nowait() one-line
    redirections to get() and put().
    + Uses (much) simpler logic for the nowait cases.
    + Regularizes the doc strings to something closer to "Guido style" <wink>.
    + Converts two stray tabs into spaces.
    + Removes confusing verbiage about the queue "not being available" from the
    docstrings -- never knew what that meant as a user, and after digging into
    the implementation still didn't know what it was trying to say.

    Also finally get rid of some obsolete commented-out access statements.
    
    A note about the previous checkin: I believe it's correct, but I found
    something strange: the file Lib/test/audiotest.au in the Python
    distribution was evidently encoded in u-LAW format but had its
    encoding set to 2, i.e. linear-8.  I hope that this is a mistake
    caused by some conversion program that produced this .au file; I just
    found it on a website.

Date:   Mon Feb 1 17:09:00 1999 +0000

    PyPcre_expand(): Fixed two memory leaks, where a PyString_FromString()
    was appended to a list.  Lists are reference count neutral, so the
    string must be DECREF'd.  Also added some checks for the return value
    of PyList_Append().
    
    Note: there are still some memory problems reported by Purify (I get
    two Array Bounds Reads still and an Unitialized Memory Read).  Also,
    in scanning the code, there appears to be some potential problems
    where return values aren't checked.  To much to attack now though.

    Patch by Sjoerd Mullender for better compatibility with the version
    from Python 1.5.1:
    
    If after __init__ finishes no new elements variable was created, this
    patch will search the instance's namespace for all attributes whose
    name start with start_ or end_ and put their value in a new elements
    instance variable.

    From: Mike Orr <mso@oz.net>
    
    In the docstring of ConfigParser.py  (Python 1.5.2b1):
        read(*filenames) -- read and parse the list of named configuration files
    
    should be:
        read(filenames) -- read and parse the list of named configuration files
    
    The method accepts a list, not a bunch of positional arguments.
    Which is good, the list is much more convenient.

    Support a canonical() method, implementable by a derived class, to be
    applied to all filenames before they are compared, looked up in the
    breaks dictionary, etc.  The default implementation does nothing --
    it's implented as fast as possible via str().  A useful implementation
    would make everything a absolute, e.g. return os.path.normcase(
    os.path.abspath(filename)).

    setup_readline(): Added a comment about memory leak (reported by
    Purify) being caused by a bug in the readline library.  Nothing we can
    do about it.
    
    Cause: readline_initialize_everything() throws away the return value
    from rl_read_init_file(), but that happens to be the last reference to
    a dynamically allocated char*.

    Added missing DECREF's in the error branches when creating a compressor or
        decompressor object.  This required adding a flag to the struct which is
        true if initialisation was completed; on object destruction, deflateEnd()
        is only called if the flag is true.

    Also add a new feature: if the first character of a menu label is

    that can be accessed through the new getvar/setvar/getrawvar API;
    the variable is named after the event to which the menu is bound.

    Added a -s option which is useful for narrowing down memory leaks.
    With -s only a single test is run.  The next test run is chosen
    sequentially from the list of all tests.

    Slight reworking of this test.  If nis.maps() gives a nis.error, then
    raise an ImportError if not running verbose.  This signals to the

    builtin_map(): Nailed memory leak.  PyList_Append() borrows a
    reference, so you have to DECREF the appended value.  This was a fun
    one!

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 27 23:13:59 1999 +0000

    builtin_complex(): Nailed memory leak.  This one's in the instance
    test for classes with a __complex__() method.  The attribute is pulled
    out of the instance with PyObject_GetAttr() but this transfers
    ownership and the function object was never DECREF'd.

    initerrno(): Nailed a not-so-tiny memory leak.  The de dictionary is
    put into the module dict, but is never DECREF'd in this function, so
    it and all its contents leak.

    \py@linkToName:  New macro to consolidate support for most internal
            hyperlinking in the PDF version.  This also allows many of the
            macros that do this stuff to be a good bit more readable.
            Takes the target name and link content as parameters.
    
    Use \py@linkToName for all internal links.

    err_input(): Nailed a small memory leak.  If the error is E_INTR, the
    v temporary variable was never decref'd.  Test this by starting up the
    interpreter, hitting C-c, then immediately exiting.
    
    Same potential leak can occur if error is E_NOMEM, since the return is
    done in the case block.  Added Py_XDECREF(v); to both blocks, just
    before the return.

    Don't say that the module defines the "following functions" and then

    Merge the two one-sentence paragraphs into a single paragraph, so it

    Patch by Chris Petrilli (not really tested since I don't know this
    module myself) to accept an option keyword argument (vars) that is
    substituted on top of the defaults that were setup in __init__.  The
    patch also fixes the problem where you can't have recusive references
    inside your configuration file.

    \py@modindex:  Format the index entry for the module index more like

    There's a macro PycString_IMPORT which the documentation listed as
    PycStringIO_IMPORT.  While arguably the name used in the documentation
    is more consistent, I think it's probably safer not to change the
    macro definition and instead fix the doco.

commit 43278f01dc01b6cc2c0a2a66692de46e3a4fb400
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 20 20:35:05 1999 +0000

    convert():  Added parameter "autoclose", which should be a sequence of
            general identifiers for which closing tags will be omitted
            when SGML is generated.  This can be used to tell the markup
            generator to drop stuff like </para>.  Note that it needs to
            be possible for the closing tag to *always* be omitted for it
            to be included in "autoclose".
    
    main():  Added command-line option "-a" / "--autoclose" to set the
            list of general identifiers passed to the convert() function
            as the "autoclose" parameter.  The list may only be specified
            once (not additive) and GIs should be comma-separated.  The
            default list includes only "para".

    Modified the "sgml" and "xml" targets to stop if the sub-makes fail in
    any subdirectory; don't continue with remaining subdirs.
    
    Added "api", "ext", "lib", "mac", "ref", and "tut" targets to only do
    submakes in those directories.  This is just a lot easier to use than
    to cd into the subdir and use make.rules directly.

    Add ability to save list of "empty" elements to a file -- enabled by

    handle_labels():  Fix problem for document fragments containing more
            than one "root" that prevented all the <label id=...> items
            from being promoted to id attributes on the enclosing chapter/
            section/... properly.

    add_module_idx(), add_idx_hook():
            Change the message printed before running buildindex.py;
            "Doing the index..." wasn't clear and could be misinterpreted
            with an inappropriate mindset.  ;-)

commit cb5540e72af8b11ac7bf55051fdda38de57b5dcf
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 19 13:26:56 1999 +0000

    (py-mode-map): Removed special bindings for C-m and C-j to
    py-newline-and-indent.  These ought to get picked up by the mapcar
    that follows; any existing binding to newline-and-indent gets shadowed
    to py-newline-and-indent.
    
    This will break some people who, e.g. bind C-m or C-j to newline but
    still want these bound to py-newline-and-indent in Python mode.  On
    the other hand, the forced binding pisses off Emacs diehards.  So
    consider this experimental and see if any tall Dutch guys complain :-)

    (py-narrow-to-defun): New command (bound to C-x n d) which mimics the
    standard narrow-to-defun but works with Python classes and methods.
    With no arg, narrows to most enclosing def/method.  With C-u arg,
    narrows to most enclosing class.

    Make <rfc> no longer an empty element but a container.  The text
    currently generated by the LaTeX and LaTeX2HTML processes is generated
    here as well, making it more flexible in the SGML version.
    
    Reduce the <args> element so that <optional> goes away; just use
    square brackets to indicate what's optional.  This makes it easier to
    read than the LaTeX, and the processor can do any checking it needs to
    in order to make sure it's legit.  Possible shortcoming: DSSSL
    processors may need more explicit markup.  Can probably hack around it
    for this case, but we'll see.

    Message.getaddrlist(): This now handles multiple occurances of the
    named header, so that if a message has, e.g. multiple CC: lines, all
    will get returned by the call to getaddrlist().  It also correctly
    handles addresses which show up in continuation lines.
    
    AdderlistClass.__init__(): Added \n to self.CR which fixes a bug that
    sometimes, an address would contain a bogus trailing newline.
    
    Message.getaddress(): In final else clause, added a test for the
    character we're at being in self.specials.  Without this, such
    characters never get consumed and we infloop.  Case in point (as
    posted to c.l.py):

    Jim Ahlstrom patch: cutoff should be a long for machines with 16-bit

    but this won't ever be needed, since the len of a list is still an

    Adjustments to allow elements with subelements as parameters.  This is

    An additional flag in the element table is used to indicate elements
    which have no "general" content, but which do have subelement
    content.  These must be flagged distinctly from empty elements.
    Currently used for \lineii, \lineiii, and \lineiv.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 13 17:09:06 1999 +0000

    \seemodule:  Fix so that each \seemodule entry gets its own paragraph,
            so they don't get run together when there's no blank line
            between them in the source.  The HTML conversion already did
            the right thing.
    
    \refmodule:  Refer to a module, using a hyperlink in the PDF version.
            Visually the same as \module.

    Vladimir Marangozov's patch:
    The separator dances too much and seems to jump by arbitrary amounts
    in arbitrary directions when I try to move it for resizing the frames.

    Set the cursor to a watch when opening the class browser (which may

    Newer, better center() -- but assumes no wrapping.

    Don't traceback when wakeup() is called when the window has been destroyed.
    This can happen when a torn-of Windows menu references closed windows.
    And Tim Peters claims that the Windows menu is his favorite to tear off...

    This now actually works.  See doc string.  It can run a module (i.e.
    import or reload) or debug it (same with debugger control).  Output
    goes to a fresh output window, only created when needed.

    Need extern decl. for fdatasync() in case it exists but isn't declared
    anywhere (or, more likely, the declaration requires a magical
    combination of _POSIX defines).

    FieldStorage.__init__(): if there is no content-type header, use
    text/plain for inner parts, but application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    for outer parts.  Honor any existing content-type header.
    
    Lower down, if the content-type header is something we don't
    understand (say because it there was a typo in the header coming from
    the client), default to text/plain for inner parts, but
    application/x-www-form-urlencoded for outer parts.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 8 15:56:28 1999 +0000

    Hack for Windows so that if (1) the exit status is nonzero and (2) we
    think we have our own DOS box (i.e. we're not started from a command
    line shell), we print a message and wait for the user to hit a key
    before the DOS box is closed.
    
    The hacky heuristic for determining whether we have our *own* DOS box
    (due to Mark Hammond) is to test whether we're on line zero...

    Ty Sarna writes:
    The following patches (relative to 1.5.2b1) enable Python dynamic
    loading to work on NetBSD platforms that use ELF (presnetly mips and
    alpha systems).  They automaticly determine wether the system is ELF or
    a.out rather than using astatic list of platforms so that when other
    NetBSD platforms move to ELF, python will continue to work without
    change.

    convert():  Make sure no line has trailing whitespace.  (docfixer.py
            checks for \n\n as a paragraph separator, LaTeX allows white
            space between the newlines.)

    The doc string for strptime had the arguments reversed -- the string
    comes first, the format second!  Scott Cotton discovered this.

    write_idxfile():  New function.  Isolate format of the external index
            data file used by buildindex.py.
    
    next_argument_id():  Removed; no longer used.
    
    next_argument():  Doesn't use next_argument_id(), just does the work.
    
    gen_target(), gen_target_name():  Removed, no longer used.  The only
            place that used them now does the (trivial) work directly.
    
    
    Lots of little changes so we never have to pass around $br_id values
    all over the place.  The only places they're used now new IDs are
    generated as needed.

Date:   Tue Jan 5 17:16:46 1999 +0000

    Patch by Charles Waldman to implement an optional nlines argument to

    do_cmd_methodline():  New function, implements indexing version of
            \methodline.
    
    Fixed up support for \withsubitem, hopefully improving the fidelity of
    the index a bit.

    This hopefully fixes the problem of having to set PATH
    in autoexec.bat in order to find the Tcl DLLs -- Tkinter calls FixTk
    which will hunt around in a few common places and then set PATH
    and try again, or else issue a big clarifying error message.

    calls was used instead of a single PyArg_ParseTuple call with an
    optional argument.

    Get rid of the strptype() declaration -- on some BSD systems, it's a
    conflict, and it should be declared in time.h anyway.

    Add sys.hexversion, which is an integer encoding the version in hexadecimal.
    In other words, hex(sys.hexversion) == 0x010502b2 for Python 1.5.2b2.
    This is derived from the new variable PY_VERSION_HEX defined in patchlevel.h.

    Checking in IDLE 0.2.
    
    Much has changed -- too much, in fact, to write down.
    The big news is that there's a standard way to write IDLE extensions;
    see extend.txt.  Some sample extensions have been provided, and
    some existing code has been converted to extensions.  Probably the
    biggest new user feature is a new search dialog with more options,
    search and replace, and even search in files (grep).
    
    This is exactly as downloaded from my laptop after returning
    from the holidays -- it hasn't even been tested on Unix yet.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 23 23:04:17 1998 +0000

    Added mt_interact() -- multithreaded version of interact().
    interact() automatically uses this on Windows (where the
    single-threaded version doesn't work).

Date:   Wed Dec 23 22:22:10 1998 +0000

    Patch by Mike Meyer:
    
    Extended the rfc822 parsedate routines to handle the cases they failed
    on in an archive of ~37,000 messages.  I believe the changes are
    compatible, in that all previously correct parsing are still correct.
    
    [I still see problems with some messages, but no showstoppers.]

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 23 21:58:38 1998 +0000

    Avoid crash in parsedate_tz() on certain invalid dates -- when the
    field assumed to be the time is in fact the year, the resulting list
    doesn't have enough items, and this isn't checked for.  Return None
    instead.

    Fix many of the specific targets in links from the index.
    
    In a number of places, I called next_argument() instead of
    next_argument_id() when the ID was also needed.  (7 places)

    through some smart macros; but the source still had the old, un-Py names).

    Marc-Andre Lemburg notes about statparse():
    
    """
    The message ID is returned lowercased and there is no way to access
    the original ID the server sent. Now at least some news servers
    are very picky about the case of the ID and return errors when
    fetching articles with mixed case given a lowercased version
    of the ID.
    
    The solution is simple: remove the string.lower() call.
    """
    
    (I might add that the lowercasing was probably introduced as a result
    of sloppy copy-and-paste coding; there's a string.lower in a similar
    piece of code a bit higher in the source, that makes more sense --
    it's lowercasing the group name.)

    - Fixed a bug where a syntax error was reported when a document
      started with white space.  (White space at the start of a document
      is valid if there is no XML declaration.)
    - Improved the speed quite a bit for documents that don't make use of
      namespaces.

    NOTE: There is still a bug of some sort in the behavior of zlib.  In
    at least one case, inflate returns Z_OK (which is typically
    interpreted to mean that more output space is needed) when it has
    finished inflating a buffer.  This has been reported as a bug to the
    zlib maintainers; we may need to change the Python interface.

    Sjoerd Mullender:
    
    File names with "funny" characters get translated wrong by
    pathname2url (any variety).  E.g. the (Unix) file "/ufs/sjoerd/#tmp"
    gets translated into "/ufs/sjoerd/#tmp" which, when interpreted as a
    URL is file "/ufs/sjoerd/" with fragment ID "tmp".
    
    Here's an easy fix.  (An alternative fix would be to change the
    various implementations of pathname2url and url2pathname to include
    calls to quote and unquote.
    
    [The main problem is with the normal use of URLs:
            url = url2pathname(file)
            transmit url
            url, tag = splittag(url)
            urlopen(url)
    ]
    
    In addition, this patch fixes some uses of unquote:
    - the host part of URLs should be unquoted
    - the file path in the FTP URL should be unquoted before it is split
      into components.
    - because of the latter, I removed all unquoting from ftpwrapper,
      and moved it to the caller, but that is not essential

    But IMHO, this problem really reveals an annoyance in Python's
    makesetup. makesetup puts the global include directories "$(INCLUDEPY)
    $(EXECINCLUDEPY)" in front of the directories defined by the module in
    Setup. Therefore global (potentially older) header files are preferred
    over the ones set by the module, which makes it hard to compile new
    versions of modules when the old versions are installed. AFAIK, the
    other way around is common practice for most other software.
    
    This patch to makesetup would be an potential fix for this problem,

    Undo the change here -- there's no point in declaring a static

    Patch by Jeff Rush:
    
    In SimpleHTTPServer.py, the server specified in test() should
    be BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer, in case the request handler should
    want to reference the two attributes added by
    BaseHTTPServer.server_bind:
    
            self.server_name = hostname
            self.server_port = port
    
    There was some Bobo CGI code that wanted access to those attributes.

    Patch by Jeff Rush:
    
    In CGIHTTPServer.py, the list of acceptable formats is -split-
    on spaces but -joined- on commas, resulting in double commas
    in the joined text.  It appears harmless to my browser but
    ought to be fixed anyway.

commit 1cbd196f9645622832890c3d70410c4c06edc416
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 25 17:13:28 1998 +0000

    Minor nit that fixes a bunch of indexing:  the way the classdesc
    environment saves the name of the last class described, method and
    member descriptions were not picking it up correctly.  Thus, many
    index entries were described as "( method)" instead of "(FooClass
    method)".  Multiple entries were collapsed in the index when
    methods/members from multiple classes share the same name.

    Fix indexing of func_code attribute; this is on a function, not a code
    object.
    
    Add "()" to method names indexed using \ttindex{}.

commit 053b8dfcde1c5ad271a44a589b4716c246e891c5
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 25 16:18:00 1998 +0000

    New version from Jim Fulton:
    
      - New copyright. (Open source)
    
      - Added new protocol for binary string pickles that
        takes out unneeded puts:
    
          p=Pickler()
          p.dump(x)
          p.dump(y)
          thePickle=p.getvalue()
    
        This has little or no impact on pickling time, but
        often reduces unpickling time and pickle size, sometimes
        significantly.
    
      - Changed unpickler to use internal data structure instead
        of list to reduce unpickling times by about a third.
    
      - Many cleanups to get rid of obfuscated error handling
        involving 'goto finally' and status variables.
    
      - Extensive reGuidofication. (formatting :)
    
      - Fixed binary floating-point pickling bug. 0.0 was not
        pickled correctly.
    
      - Now use binary floating point format when saving
        floats in binary mode.
    
      - Fixed some error message spelling error.

    Rationalize a word-space markup to not break in the LaTeX->*ML
    conversion tools currently being constructed.
    
    Add a chapter from Jim Fulton on using Misc/Makefile.pre.in.  Still
    preliminary.  The "Dynamic Loading" chapter needs to be updated (and
    possibly removed, since it's no longer an issue for most (any?)

    Whoops!  One the "redundant" initializations removed by Vladimir in
    the previous patch wasn't -- there was a path through the code that
    bypassed all initializations.  Thanks to Just for reporting the bug!

    Rewrote the section on sys.exit(), documenting other argument types

    Don't duplicate the information on what's empty; rely on the input

    Accept a non-list sequence for the long options (request by Jack Jansen).
    
    Because it might be a common mistake to pass a single string, this
    situation is treated separately.
    
    Since we were making a copy of the longopts list anyway, we now use
    the list() function -- this made it necessary to change all uses of
    the local variable (and argument) 'list' to something more meaningful,
    i.e., 'opts'.
    
    Also added docstrings (copied from the library manual) and removed the
    (now redundant) module comments.

    audio(7I) suggests that applications do the following to get the
    device and control pseudo-device:
    
    - first look for the device filename in the environment variable
      AUDIODEV.
    
    - if not found, use /dev/audio
    
    - calculate the control device by tacking "ctl" onto the base device
      name.
    
    We now do this.  Also, if the open fails, we call
    PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename() to give a more informative error
    message.
    
    Added a fileno() method to the audio object returned from open().
    This returns the file descriptor which can be used by applications to
    set up SIGPOLL notification, as per the manpage.

    The TemporaryFile() function has a security leak -- because the
    filenames generated are easily predictable, it is possible to trick an
    unsuspecting program into overwriting another file by creating a
    symbolic link with the predicted name.  Fix this by using the
    low-level os.open() function with the O_EXCL flag and mode 0700.  On
    non-Unix platforms, presumably there are no symbolic links so the
    problem doesn't exist.  The explicit test for Unix (posix, actually)
    makes it possible to change the non-Unix logic to work without a
    try-except clause.
    
    The mktemp() file is as unsafe as ever.

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>

    Many changes to support a second mode of operation.  Pynche can now be
    run either as a standalone application (by running pynche or
    pynche.pyw), or as a modal dialog inside another application.  This
    can be done by importing pyColorChooser and running askcolor().  The
    API for this is the same as the tkColorChooser.askcolor() API, namely:
    
        When `Okay' is hit, askcolor() returns ((r, g, b), "name").  When
        `Cancel' is hit, askcolor() returns (None, None).
    
    Note the following differences:
    
        1. pyColorChooser.askcolor() takes an optional keyword `master'
           which if set tells Pynche to run as a modal dialog.  `master'
           is a Tkinter parent window.  Without the `master' keyword
           Pynche runs standalone.
    
        2. in pyColorChooser.askcolor() will return a Tk/X11 color name as
           "name" if there is an exact match, otherwise it will return a
           color spec, e.g. "#rrggbb".  tkColorChooser can't return a
           color name.
    
    There are also some UI differences when running standalone vs. modal.
    When modal, there is no "File" menu, but instead there are "Okay" and
    "Cancel" buttons.
    
    The implementation of all this is a bit of a hack, but it seems to
    work moderately well.  I'm not guaranteeing the pyColorChooser.Chooser
    class has the same semantics as the tkColorChooser.Chooser class.

    The FieldStorage constructor calls the read_multi method.  The read_multi

    I fixed this by passing these arguments to read_multi and then on to the

    Looks like I didn't test this interactively.  The EventHook() code was
    broken; it asked for the current thread state when there was none.
    Fixed by using the saved event_tstate.

    Patch by Jonathan Giddy (with some cleanup by me) to always use the

    Greg Stein: Implement the new bf_getcharbuffer function, indicating
    that (as far as the data type is concerned!) this is character data.

commit 36eef3c1739cdec3956e5ad86b5887985d249302
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 8 02:10:56 1998 +0000

    Changes by Greg Stein (code) and GvR (design).
    
    Add a new member to the PyBufferProcs struct, bf_getcharbuffer.  For
    backward compatibility, this member should only be used (this includes
    testing for NULL!) when the flag Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GETCHARBUFFER is set
    in the type structure, below.  Note that if its flag is not set, we
    may be looking at an extension module compiled for 1.5.1, which will
    have garbage at the bf_getcharbuffer member (because the struct wasn't
    as long then).  If the flag is one, the pointer may still be NULL.
    The function found at this member is used in a similar manner as
    bf_getreadbuffer, but it is known to point to 8-bit character data.
    (See discussion in getargs.c checked in later.)
    
    As a general feature for extending the type structure and the various
    structures that (may) hang off it in a backwards compatible way, we
    rename the tp_xxx4 "spare" slot to tp_flags.  In 1.5.1 and before,
    this slot was always zero.  In 1.5.1, it may contain various flags
    indicating extra fields that weren't present in 1.5.1.  The only flag
    defined so far is for the bf_getcharbuffer member of the PyBufferProcs
    struct.
    
    Note that the new spares (tp_xxx5 - tp_xxx8), once they become used,
    should also be protected by a flag (or flags) in tp_flags.

Date:   Wed Oct 7 16:39:47 1998 +0000

    BSDI specific patches, inspired by Nigel Head and otto@mail.olympus.net.
    
    Also (non-BSDI specific):
    
    - Change the CHECK_STATUS() macro so it tests for nonzero error codes
    instead of negative error codes only (this was needed for BSDI, but
    appears to be correct according to the PTHREADS spec).
    
    - use memset() to zero out the allocated lock structure.  Again, this
    was needed for BSDI, but can't hurt elsewhere either.

    Fix suggested by Sjoerd (long ago!) to get a better error message when
    there's a syntax error.  (In particular, display the correct
    filename).  This changes the API: if there's a syntax error, the
    function now returns normally after dumping the error to sys.stderr.
    I changed Sjoerd's use of string.join(string.split(...)) with
    string.replace().

    Changes by Eric Raymond:
    
    1. Generate a correct Content-Length header visible through the info() method
       if a request to open an FTP URL gets a length in the response to RETR.
    
    2. Take a third argument to urlretrieve() that makes it possible to progress-
       meter an urlretrieve call (this is what I needed the above change for).
       See the second patch band below for details.
    
    3. To avoid spurious errors, I commented out the gopher test.  The target
       document no longer exists.

    Reworked it quite a bit.  There are now two classes: a base class,
    InteractiveInterpreter, which handles parsing and interpreter state
    but doesn't know deal with buffering or prompting or input file
    naming.  And a derived class, InteractiveConsole, which adds buffering
    and prompting and supports setting the filename once.  Also tweak the
    algorithm in compile_command() a bit so that input consisting of all
    blank lines or comments always succeeds immediately, and note the fact
    that apart from SyntaxError it can also raise OverflowError.

    In load_inst(), when instantiating an instance the old way (i.e. when
    there's an __getinitargs__() method), if a TypeError occurs, catch and
    reraise it but add info to the error about the class name being
    instantiated.  This makes debugging a lot easier if __getinitargs__()
    returns something bogus (e.g. a string instead of a singleton tuple).

    callback deletes the window.

commit 98b6246c0c60f2831b0c7a66d8c0659ebac1ec32
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 14 18:51:11 1998 +0000

    Several changes that Python carry on in the face of errors in the
    initialization of class exceptions.  Specifically:
    
    init_class_exc(): This function now returns an integer status of the
    class exception initialization.  No fatal errors in this method now.
    Also, use PySys_WriteStderr() when writing error messages.  When an
    error occurs in this function, 0 is returned, but the partial creation
    of the exception classes is not undone (this happens elsewhere).
    
    Things that could trigger the fallback:
    
        - exceptions.py fails to be imported (due to syntax error, etc.)
    
        - one of the exception classes is missing (e.g. due to library
          version mismatch)
    
        - exception class can't be inserted into __builtin__'s dictionary
    
        - MemoryError instance can't be pre-allocated
    
        - some other PyErr_Occurred
    
    newstdexception(): Changed the error message.  This is still a fatal
    error because if the string based exceptions can't be created, we
    really can't continue.
    
    initerrors(): Be sure to xdecref the .exc field, which might be
    non-NULL if class exceptions init was aborted.
    
    _PyBuiltin_Init_2(): If class exception init fails, print a warning
    message and reinstate the string based exceptions.

    There was a confusion in my checkin of the code to support list() with
    and without a message number argument: the argument was called 'msg'
    but the code expected it to be called 'which'.  In line with the other
    methods, I've renamed the argument to 'which', and adapted the doc
    string not to refer to 'msg'.

    pdb.doc         Updated to reflect better the various changes.

commit 2424f855f3647e39800d2eca9e4085cfe2f78f01
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Sep 11 22:50:09 1998 +0000

    Richard Wolff's changes:
    
    pdb.py  Uses the Breakpoint class so one can enable/disable breakpoints,
            set temporary ones, set ignore counts, and conditions.  The last
            can be set using the 'b' command
                    b 243 , i>4             ( b 243,i>4 if you are space adverse)
            or with the condition command so conditions can be changed
            for a particular breakpoint.
    
            Breakpoints are numbered from 1 on, and if a breakpoint is deleted,
            the number is not reused.  All the breakpoint handling commands
            refer to breakpoints by number.  To be consistent, the clear command
            does so as well, which is the one change from the original pdb that
            is not transparent.  Thus only the breakpoint command 'b' uses a
            line number or file:line or method.  You can also give
                    b whrandom.random    and the method will be searched for along
            sys.path.  This is implemented with an 'egrep' command and so
            is not as portable as it might be.  [ see  lineinfo() and
            lineinfoCmd ]
    
            Breakpoints cannot be set at a line that is blank or a '#' comment
            or starts a triply quoted comment.  This is because I would like
            this behavior in my DDD interface and think it reasonable for
            pdb as well.  It can be removed readily, however as it is all
            incorporated in the routine checkline().  If one attempts to
            set a breakpoint at a 'def' line, the breakpoint is automatically
            moved to the first executable line after the 'def'.  This too is
            in checkline().
    
            do_EOF() returns zero so typing an end-of-file character as a command
            does nothing.  'quit' does the quitting.
    
            The routine defaultFile() is present so as to preserve the current
            pdb behavior and yet allow me to override it in pydb.
    
            There's some code in lineinfo() that is probably mainly useful only
            for pydb and if you prefer, much up to the comment "Best first guess"
            could be removed.
    
            Keith Davidson provided the code for handling $HOME/.pdbrc and
            ./.pdbrc, and it has been incorporated.  He also provided the
            alias handling routine.  I modified it a bit so it could live
            nicely in precmd().  He and I have been in contact; he has the
            new pdb (and pydb) with his code incorporated.  He also asked
            about the possibility of allowing multiple commands on one
            line, such as step;step  or s;s  or with an alias such as
                    alias ct tbreak %1 ; continue
            and since it was so easy, that's in place as well.  It's a simple
            'split the line at the first ";"' operation and puts the second
            half in the command queue (self.cmdqueue).  This has the unfortunate
            effect of destroying a line like   print "i: "+i+"; j: "+j
            but either there's a simple way to deal with this, or my attitude
            will remain that pdb is a debugger, not a compiler/parser/etc.
            An alias like   alias 4s  s;;s;
            will work because the adjacent and trailing ";" act like a <cr> which
            repeats the last command.  Of course, either s;s;s;s or s;;;  would be
            a bit more sensible.
    
            The help commands have been updated.

    Richard Wolff's changes:
    
    bdb.py  now has a class definition called Breakpoint along with
            associated methods.  There's no reason why this class has to
            be there; if you prefer it elsewhere, 'tis easily done.
    
    (Minor reformatting by GvR; e.g. moved Breakpoint's doc string to
    proper point.)

    Richard Wolff's changes:
    
    cmd.py  has incorporated the changes we discussed a couple of weeks ago
            (a command queue, returning line from precmd, and stop from postcmd)
            and some changes to help that were occasioned because I wanted to
            inherit from pdb which inherits from cmd.py and the help routine
            didn't look for commands or the associated help deeply enough.

    Now that we have standard (optional) long long support, the long long

    (PyLong_FromLongLong() and PyLong_AsLongLong()).  By Sjoerd Mullender.

    Changes by Richard Wolff:
    
    1) I added a command queue which is helpful to me (at least so far) and
       would also allow syntax like 's;s' (step; step) in conjunction with precmd
    2) doc_leader allows the derived class to print a message before the help
       output.  Defaults to current practise of a blank line
    3) nohelp allows one to override the 'No help on' message.  I need
        'Undefined command: "%s".  Try "help".'
    4) Pass line to self.precmd to allow one to do some parsing: change first
       word to lower case, strip out a leading number, whatever.
    5) Pass the result of onecmd and the input line to postcmd.  This allows
       one to ponder the stop result before it is effective.
    6) emptyline() requires a   if self.lastcmd:  conditional because if the
       first command is null (<cr>), you get an infinite recursion with the
       code as it stands.

    Comment out the print statement about underflow.  (This only seems to
    happen when you use a non-keyword argument after a keyword argument,
    and in this case you also get a syntax error.  I fully suspect that
    the underflow is caused by the code that stops generating code when it
    detects the syntax error, but I can't find the culprit right now.  I
    know, I know.)

    of 'long long' are replaced with it.

    Y2K fix affecting asctime(), mktime(), strftime().
    
    2-digit years are now converted using rules that are (according to
    Fredrik Lundh) recommended by POSIX or X/Open: 0-68 mean 2000-2068,
    69-99 mean 1969-1999.
    
    2-digit years are now only accepted if time.accept2dyear is set to a
    nonzero integer; if it is zero or not an integer or absent, only year
    values >= 1900 are accepted.  Year values 100-1899 and negative year
    values are never accepted.
    
    The initial value of time.accept2dyear depends on the environment
    variable PYTHONY2K: if PYTHONY2K is set and non-empty,
    time.accept2dyear is initialized to 0; if PYTHONY2K is empty or not
    set, time.accept2dyear is initialized to 0.

    (py-process-filter): Deleted this function.  In order to fix
    interactions with newer Emacsen, I've rewritten the way all the
    process filters work in the *Python* buffer.  We use more of the
    comint infrastructure, specifically the default process filter.  This
    means that scrolling is now handled by the default comint variables
    including comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output.  Note that this is
    somewhat experimental change!
    
    (py-comint-output-filter-function): Moved to here from the obsolete
    py-process-filter function, the logic to pop and exec the next queued
    file waiting to be executed.
    
    (py-execute-file): Don't bind comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output to t,
    and save the excursion when inserting the "working on" message.  This
    lets the standard comint scrolling variables as set by the user,
    continue to work.
    
    (python-mode, py-shell, py-describe-mode): Remove description of
    py-scroll-process-buffer.  Also in py-shell, make
    comint-output-filter-functions buffer-local, and add
    py-comint-output-filter-function to this hook (instead of setting the
    process filter).
    
    (py-scroll-process-buffer): Deleted this variable.  See comint
    variables including comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output.
    
    (py-execute-region): When exec files are being queued, push the next
    temp file on the end of the list.
    
    (py-submit-bug-report): Removed reporting of py-scroll-process-buffer.

    Added an example that uses signal.alarm() to time out an os.open() that
        takes too long. This example relies on the fact that raising an
        exception in a signal handler causes the exception to be re-raised
        when the main line of the program resumes execution.  Is this guaranteed
        in CPython, or is this something that just happens to work by accident?
    
    Also fixed a typo.

    I give in (after all these years): renaming config.c to macconfig.c to forestall
    the continuous name conflicts which cause the wrong config.c to be found.

    (imenu-example--create-python-index-engine): Fix nesting breakage when
    a method definition has args that span multiple lines; be sure to go
    to the beginning of the method definition -- but watch out for the
    match-data!

    img_tag():  For \n to be interpreted as a newline, the string must use double
            quote, not single quotes.  Ugh.

    Enter Jim Fulton's latest version.  He writes:
    
    I had to make a slight diddle to work with Python 1.4, which
    we and some of our customers are still using. :(
    
    I've also made a few minor enhancements:
    
      - You can now both get and set the memo using a 'memo'
        attribute.  This is handy for certain advanced applications
        that we have.
    
      - Added a 'binary' attribute to get and set the binary
        mode for a pickler.
    
      - Added a somewhat experimental 'fast' attribute.  When this
        is set, objects are not placed in the memo during pickling.
        This should lead to faster pickling and smaller pickles in
        cases where:
    
          o you *know* there are no circular references, and
    
          o either you've:
    
            - preloaded the memo with class information
              by pickling classes in non-fast mode or by
              manipilating the memo directly, or
    
            - aren't pickling instances.

    Do the magic to use the new buttons (with shorter names!) instead of the old
    ones.  Get the <IMG> width & height right.  New design for the navigation
    bars, including the document title as well as the navigation links/buttons.

commit 31bb8cef2c528591bc6b2abefff34cbcbfd121f3
Author: Jeremy Hylton <jeremy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Thu Aug 13 19:57:46 1998 +0000

    Change interface to sendmail: if the destination address is a string
    instead of a list, turn it into a list containing that string.  This
    avoids an apparently common newbie mistake -- passing in a single
    string for the destination and have it treated as a sequence of
    characters.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Aug 13 16:44:44 1998 +0000

    Better error messages when a sequence is indexed with a non-integer.
    Previously, this said "unsubscriptable object"; in 1.5.1, the reverse
    problem existed, where None[''] would complain about a non-integer
    index.  This fix does the right thing in all cases (for get, set and
    del item).

    SIOUX, Tcl and Tk also need to be rebuilt (and tcl/tk need work)

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 12 17:08:37 1998 +0000

    Massive cleanup:  Use Makefiles in subdirs properly, move most of the
    detailed build rules to the subdirs.  Allow pretty much every useful target
    to be built directly from the top dir (no change in output location).

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 12 17:06:03 1998 +0000

    Re-written to actually perform the conversion instead of using a sub-make
    with the parent Makefile.  Will also force the auxillary files to be
    created if they need to be.

    New makefile which only contains the source dependencies specific to each

    Back out of a recent policy change (Mark Hammond disagreed).
    The registry always comes first and the default is always appended.

commit d10552379dd85f432545ba3c9199d2b232593f30
Author: Jeremy Hylton <jeremy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Tue Aug 11 19:52:51 1998 +0000

    Two fixes to find_class:
    
    1. Only DECREF the class's module when the module is retrieved via
    PyImport_Import.  If it is retrieved from the modules dictionary with
    PyDict_GetItem, it is using a borrowed reference.
    
    2. If the module doesn't define the desired class, raise the same
    SystemError that pickle.py does instead of returning an AttributeError
    (which is cryptic at best).
    
    Also, fix the PyArg_ParseTuple in cpm_loads (the externally visible
    loads) function:  Use "S" instead of "O" because cStringIO will croak
    with a "bad arguments to internal function" if passed anything other
    than a string.

    Ok, blank.pbm is free to go.
    
    The rest of these are new or replaced.  The buttons are now all the same
    width.  They have the transparency set right.  They still need the attention
    of a designer.  But they work, and we have a real button for the Modules
    Index.

    Use Perl's rename() function instead of system(); there's no need for two

    Use repr() on the filename in EnvironmentError.__str__().  This
    displays funny characters, like spaces or control characters, more
    clearly (one of my pet peeves in error messages).  Also only suppress
    the filename if it is None; display it if it is '', since that would
    be a genuine (illegal) filename passed in!

Date:   Tue Aug 11 15:07:39 1998 +0000

    Patch by Just van Rossum that changes how we search for submodules of
    frozen packages.  (I *think* this means that we can now have a
    built-in module bar that's a submodule of a frozen package foo, by
    registering the built-in module with a name "foo.bar" in the table of
    builtin modules.)

    Two patches by Jason Harper:
    
    - Faster conversion to string for binary bases: linear instead of quadratic!
    
    - Allocate smaller result for certain masking ops, e.g. (1L<<30000) & 1.

    Control when/where navigation bars will appear: top & bottom of each page.
    
    Include an additional button to the module index in the nav. bars if we
    generate a module index.  Still need a button image, but the ALT text should
    do for now.

Date:   Mon Aug 10 21:46:24 1998 +0000

    (imenu-example--python-method-regexp): Patch from Christian Tanzer:
    "3.67 fixes Imenu as far as classes are concerned, but some default
    values for function arguments are still not supported."
    
    This ought to fix that problem.

commit 12c9294ea395100ca24ba90af2798e8b7ca968b5
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 10 21:44:37 1998 +0000

    (py-compute-indentation): Changes to the `t' condition which affect
    indetnation of normal statements: The regular expression that searches
    for indenting comment lines has been changed to not require a
    space/tab after the first `#'.  We then explicitly look for
    py-block-comment-prefix depending on the value of
    py-honor-comment-indentation.
    
    I think this more accurately reflects the documentation for
    py-honor-comment-indentation.

    Huge number of docstring changes, typo fixes, rewordings, GNU standard
    conformations, etc., etc. inspired and given by Michael Ernst.  These
    include error string fixes, moving of comments to docstrings, some
    other non-related typos, terminology standardizing (b/w TP and myself,
    and b/w myself and myself :-) although more can still be done.
    E.g. "outdenting" => "dedenting".

    This file's previous log message is bogus.  The real change is that
    when it gets the path from the registry, it no longer appends the

    Different version games:
    - MS_DLL_ID is now set to "1.5" instead of "1.5.x" so Mark Hammond's

    (py-execute-region): When temp-names are broken (Emacs 19.34), a

    Add built-in string variables 'quit' and 'exit' that display a hint on
    how to exit (in a platform dependent way!).  We use os.sep to
    determine which platform we're on, since I expect that this will work
    better for minority platforms.

    Add warning that mutable argument defaults are evaluated only once;
    with examples and workaround.  This keeps coming up, and I believe
    that this section in the tutorial may have been (in part) the source
    of the confusion.  While it didn't show examples with [] for a default,
    it also didn't emphasize enough why that would be a bad idea, and
    while it did say that defaults are evaluated at the point of function
    definition, the example was not relevant for this issue.

    Variant of AMK's patch to produce text versions of HOWTO documents.
    
    This ensures that the text version uses latex2html's -split 1 option, without
    affecting HTML produced in the same run, and also minimizes the number of
    l2h runs needed if --split 1 was used for an HTML run.

    build_html():  Simplify, so there's only one version of the latex2html
            command line.
    
    l2hoption():  Convenience function, to write out an option to the aux. init.
            file only if set.
    
    Added --iconserver option to set the $ICONSERVER variable in latex2html; this
    requires the use of an auxillary init. file since this can't be initialized
    using a standard latex2html command-line option.  So the aux. init. file is
    used for just about all the special options since it has to be written anyway
    when $ICONSERVER needs to be set.

    Added gethostbyname_ex(), which returns the same kind of data as
    gethostbyaddr().  (Plain gethostbyname() returns only the IP address.)
    This moves the code shared by gethostbyaddr() and gethostbyname_ex()
    to a subroutine.

    Support case insensitive treatment of os.environ keys on Windows and
    DOS (as well as OS/2).  I presume that making a call to putenv() with
    a lowercase key will actually do the right thing.  I know this is so
    on Windows/DOS, and I expect it is so OS/2 -- but the old OS/2 code
    didn't assume this.  (I don't know if the person who provided the OS/2
    patch was clueless or just didn't care about DOS and Windows.)
    
    Also ripped out the support for pickling -- as of 1.5, this is no
    longer needed to make pickling work.

    Generalized so it's useful for testing other packages, by Andrew
    Kuchling @ CNRI.

commit 3357561476d3b5570ca9e4936baee444e504c39f

Date:   Fri Jul 31 13:40:05 1998 +0000

    Added randrange to list of exported functions.

commit 187f154243eb43b2d81f9b253458a16880e1b0bb
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 31 13:39:44 1998 +0000

    Introducing randrange([start,] stop [,step]) -- same as
    choice(range(start, stop, step)) but faster.  This addresses the
    problem that randint() was accidentally defined as taking an inclusive
    range (how unpythonic).
    
    The code is longish because Tim Peters insisted that it reject
    non-integral arguments while I insisted that it be not much slower
    than randint(); the compromise satisfies both but is somewhat
    convoluted.
    
    Also changed randint() to be implemented through randrange().  This is
    a semantic change because old randint() didn't test its arguments for
    validity.  (It also makes randrange() win any contest with randint()
    :-)

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 24 13:56:11 1998 +0000

    Move files around to get the names to match the module names except for
    case.  Two modules (SocketServer, BaseHTTPServer) still don't match; those
    names are just too long!

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 24 13:54:29 1998 +0000

    Reduce the number of levels in the Table of Contents by one, mostly for the
    Python Library Reference.  The other manuals do not suffer.
    
    This does not affect HOWTO documents.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 24 13:02:17 1998 +0000

    Remove item about one section === one module; done.

Date:   Thu Jul 23 21:41:02 1998 +0000

    \textunderscore:  Re-define with a width that's more appropriate for the
            courier font used in Python code.  This still isn't *good*, but
            makes the width about right in most cases.  (Exception: it's now
            a little wide in \var words.)

    Added descriptions of EnvironmentError and OSError; updated IOError to
    reflect its new place in the exception hierarchy; fixed typos, etc.

    Updated the description of os.error to reflect the fact that it is now
    equivalent to exceptions.OSError.

Date:   Thu Jul 23 19:33:08 1998 +0000

    Use the new module synopsis syntax, even though we don't need a synopsis table
    for this chapter.  This protects against backend changes for \declaremodule.

commit 8cab549c0ac7b591026353928b21d5883d494ad6
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 23 19:13:52 1998 +0000

    use_latex():  Hack to pass .syn files though uniq, so that the last module
            in a HOWTO document isn't listed in the synopsis table twice.  This
            will do until the real bug is found (low priority!).

    'name space' -> 'namespace'

commit a488f30627b899dc86693f145bff704d0751f256
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 23 17:50:45 1998 +0000

    Lots of new stuff for "module synopsis support."  Public interface consists
    of three macros, one which replaces some of the current conventions used in
    the module sections:
    
      \declaremodule:  Requires two parameters: module type (standard, builtin,
            extension), and the module name.  An optional parameter should be
            given as the basis for the module's "key" used for linking to or
            referencing the section.  The "key" should only be given if the
            module's name contains underscores, and should be the name with the
            underscore's stripped.  This should be the first thing after the
            \section used to introduce the module.
    
      \modulesynopsis:  Requires a single parameter: a short, one-liner
            description of the module that can be used as part of the chapter
            introduction.  This should probably be placed just after the
            \declaremodule, but may be placed anywhere in the same section.
    
      \localmoduletable:  No parameters.  If a .syn file exists for the current
            chapter (or for the entire document in howto docs), a synopsistable
            is created with the contents loaded from the .syn file.
    
    Some re-organization due to module synopsis support.
    
    Some \def's changed to \newcommand's.

    \py@ModSynopsisFilename:  New macro; gives names of the .syn file.

commit 1cc6d53f6512c0aadda7458dfc27b6382e81ac8e
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 23 17:36:14 1998 +0000

    \py@ModSynopsisFilename:  New macro; gives names of the "current" .syn file.
    
    \chapter:  Extended, ensures that a pending module synopsis is written out
            and then closes the .syn file for the preceeding chapter.

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 23 16:14:40 1998 +0000

    Several changes to support inclusion of filename in relevent
    exceptions:
    
    posix_error_with_filename(): New function which calls
    PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename()
    
    The following methods have been changed to call
    posix_error_with_filename():
    
        posix_1str()
        posix_strint()
        posix_strintint()
        posix_do_stat()
        posix_mkdir()
        posix_utime()
        posix_readlink()
        posix_open()
    
    INITFUNC(): os.error (nee PosixError) is PyExc_OSError

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 23 16:07:02 1998 +0000

    PyFile_FromString(): If an exception occurs, pass in the filename that
    was used so it's reflected in the IOError.  Call
    PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename().

commit 97d951533e71b74a1a2502feda4a587eb9fb7d98
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 23 16:05:56 1998 +0000

    PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename(): New function which supports setting
    an exception from errno, with a supplied filename (primarily used by
    IOError and OSError).  If class exceptions are used then the exception
    is instantiated with a 3-tuple: (errno, strerror, filename).  For
    backwards compatibility reasons, if string exceptions are used,
    filename is ignored.
    
    PyErr_SetFromErrno(): Implement in terms of
    PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename().

commit 2dfe4de614b9006693d5053fbba462449609ba8e
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 23 16:03:46 1998 +0000

    Added support for including the filename in IOErrors and OSErrors that
    involve a filesystem path.  To that end:
    
    - Changed IOError to EnvironmentError and added a hack which checks
      for arg of len 3.  When constructed with a 3-tuple, the third item
      is the filename and this is squirreled away in the `filename'
      attribute.   However, for in-place unpacking backwards
      compatibility, self.args still only gets the first two items.  Added
      a __str__() which prints the filename if it is given.
    
    - IOError now inherits from EnvironmentError
    
    - New class OSError which also inherits from EnvironmentError and is
      used by the posix module.

commit d086a1a8649ca1bb0720d701112c698ab5463db2
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 23 15:59:57 1998 +0000

    Added support for two new standard errors: EnvironmentError and
    OSError.  The EnvironmentError serves primarily as the (common
    implementation) base class for IOError and OSError.  OSError is used
    by posixmodule.c
    
    Also added tuple definition of EnvironmentError when using string
    based exceptions.

    Document how to make a POST request with urlopen().
    
    Change the argument name for quote() and quote_plus() to safe (which
    matches the implementation).
    
    Add doc for the *new* function urlencode().

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 22 21:33:23 1998 +0000

    Speed up the implementation of quote().
    
    Fix the implementation of quote_plus().  (It wouldn't treat '+' in the
    original data right.)
    
    Add urlencode(dict) which is handy to create the data for sending a
    POST request with urlopen().

    with a null movie (giving time to all active movies)
    - Made the graphics world parameter to SetMovieGWorld optional.

Date:   Tue Jul 21 21:56:41 1998 +0000

    When comparing objects, always check that tp_compare is not NULL
    before calling it.  This check was there when the objects were of the
    same type *before* coercion, but not if they initially differed but
    became the same *after* coercion.

    Update the documentation.  Get rid of the section "how it works"
    (which is not very relevant when you're in the debugger :-).

commit b5699c7240e085cb20972f388aa8e21387c48275
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 20 23:13:54 1998 +0000

    Added support for specifying a filename for a breakpoint, roughly
    according to an idea by Harri Pasanen (but with different syntax).
    This affects the 'break' and 'clear' commands and their help
    functions.  Also added a helper method lookupmodule().
    
    Also:
    
    - Try to import readline (important when pdb is used from/as a script).
    - Get rid of reference to ancient __privileged__ magic variable.
    - Moved all import out of functions to the top.
    - When used as a script, check that the script file exists.

    Add test for failure of the getattr call in pcre_expand() -- it used

commit 0e5ab17ad34c8810f0626409fd3d1c8dc85e68ac
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 17 20:18:49 1998 +0000

    Get a 3- to 4-fold speedup for sub()/subn(), split() and findall() by
    not calling self.search(); instead, call self.code.match() directly
    and interpret the list of registers it returns directly.  This saves
    the overhead of instantiating a MatchObject for each hit, basically
    inlining search() as well as group().  When a MatchObject is still
    needed, one is allocated and reused for the duration of the scan.

    Add tests for list self-assigns.  (Sorry, this should have been here
    before JPython 1.0 came out.)

    Avoid using calloc().  This triggered an obscure bug on multiprocessor
    Sparc Solaris 2.6 (fully patched!) that I don't want to dig into, but
    which I suspect is a bug in the multithreaded malloc library that only
    shows up when run on a multiprocessor.  (The program wasn't using
    threads, it was just using the multithreaded C library.)

    From: Nicolas CHAUVAT <nico@caesium.fr>
    
    In the bbox method of Group (Canvas.py file), you should read
    
            return self.canvas._getints(self._do('bbox'))
    
    instead of
    
            return self._getints(self._do('bbox'))

    Tk.__init__():  In computing baseName, add ".pyo" to list of dropped
            extensions, and include the "." in ".pyc".  Still need to get
            _tkinter.c:Tkapp_New() to use baseName....

    Temporarily get rid of the registration of Tcl_Finalize() as a
    low-level Python exit handler.  This can attempt to call Python code
    at a point that the interpreter and thread state have already been
    destroyed, causing a Bus Error.  Given the intended use of
    Py_AtExit(), I'm not convinced that it's a good idea to call it
    earlier during Python's finalization sequence...  (Although this is
    the only use for it in the entire distribution.)

    Added a delete() method to menu entries. Only the last entry of a menu
    can be deleted, but that's good enough for things like a "Windows"
    menu with the dynamic list of open windows at the end of the menu.

    If the preference filename resource is empty don't try to open or
    create the preferences file. This is so that frozen programs don't
    interfere with an existing Python installation, or leave turds in the
    Preferences folder.

    All import-related code has moved to macimport.c.
    
    There's also new support for importing code fragments: if a file on
    sys.path contains a PYD resource with resourcename equal to the name
    of the module to be imported this PYD resource should contain a
    (pascal) string with the name of a code fragment to load. This allows
    freezing Python programs without access to source or a development
    environment.

Date:   Fri Jul 10 18:03:50 1998 +0000

    Add special case to PySequence_List() so that list() of a list is
    faster (using PyList_GetSlice()).  Also added a test for a NULL
    argument, as with PySequence_Tuple().  (Hmm...  Better names for these
    two would be PyList_FromSequence() and PyTuple_FromSequence().  Oh well.)

Date:   Fri Jul 10 17:37:30 1998 +0000

    Small changes to map() and filter():
    
    (1) If a sequence S is shorter than len(S) indicated, don't fail --
    just use the shorter size.  (I.e, len(S) is just a hint.)
    
    (2) Implement the special case map(None, S) as list(S) -- it's faster.

commit bfc725bf64c1da301fe29b9722efc56e34799cf4
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 10 16:22:44 1998 +0000

    Changed PySequence_List() and PySequence_Tuple() to support
    "indefinite length" sequences.  These should still have a length, but
    the length is only used as a hint -- the actual length of the sequence
    is determined by the item that raises IndexError, which may be either
    smaller or larger than what len() returns.  (This is a novelty; map(),
    filter() and reduce() only allow the actual length to be larger than
    what len() returns, not shorter.  I'll fix that shortly.)

    Added a function SetUserItemHandler: this takes a function(dialog,
    item) as parameter and returns a handle suitable for passing to
    SetDialogItem as a user-item redraw routine. Note that you can
    only make one of these, for now.

    (1) Added a sys.exc_info() emulation.  (It returns None for the traceback.)
    
    (2) Made the test script a bit fancier -- you can now use it to run
    arbitrary scripts in restricted mode, and it will do the right thing.
    (The interactive mode is still pretty lame; should integrate this with
    code.interact().)

    Sigh.  The hack to enable special treatment for errno on SGI machines
    must be enabled here, otherwise the errno we set on overflows is not
    the errno that's being read by compile.c.  Wonder how many other files
    that do their own "#include config.h" need this too :-(
    
    (Because of the structure of autoconf, it's not so simple to get this
    into config.h...)

    Fix two unrelated problems in the same area:
    
    (1) reorder the tests for -Olimit 1500 and -OPT:Olimit=0 so that the
    latter test is performed first, and if it works, the former test is
    skipped.  This should get rid of the problem that the new SGI
    compilers accept both but emit a warning about -Olimit 1500.
    
    (2) The DGUX hack was somehow split in two by the Olimit tests,
    probably as the result of a non-context diff.  Moved this back
    together again, after the Olimit tests.

    allows searching for both classes and defs (stopping at the nearest
    construct).

    (py-comment-indent-function): A replacement for
    comment-indent-function's default lambda value (in simple.el), this
    version finally kills this nit: auto-filling a comment that starts in
    column zero with filladapt turned off would cascade the #'s to the

    Now auto-filling seems to work with or without filladapt, and with the
    comment starting in any column.
    
    (python-mode): Set comment-indent-function.

    On Windows, put the select file descriptor arrays on the heap.
    This is because they are huge and the stack is limited on Windows.
    Other platforms keep declaring it on the stack.

    Gotta have an __init__() method -- pdb.py calls it!

commit bfa3f6b673d80de48c2bb9a85cf942a958b97374
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 1 20:41:12 1998 +0000

    Several changes:
    
    1. Convert to using re module
    
    2. Added two new exception classes
    
        a. MissingSectionHeaderError which signals an early parsing
           exception when options appear in the file before any section
           header.  Previously a bogus TypeError was thrown deeper down.
    
        b. ParsingError which collates any non-fatal parsing errors.
           ConfigParser.read() will raise this after the entire file was
           parsed if any errors occurred during parsing (client could just
           catch the exception and continue, because the ConfigParser
           instance would still be initialized with the valid data).
    
       (small note: Error.__msg => Error._msg)
    
    3. ConfigParser.__read() now uses re which has the following minor
       semantic change: underscore is now allowed in section header and
       option name.  Also, because of the old regexps, theoretically.
       Fixed continuation line bug reported by F. Lundh.
    
    4. It seemed that the old ConfigParser automatically added the option
       `name' to every section, which contained the name of the section.
       This seemed bogus to me so I took it out.

    Added a section to the chapter on modules, describing the package system.
    The text is almost completely from GvR's essay on packages; some
    introductory paragraphs have been removed, and everything after the
    'Details' section in the HTML has been dropped (seems too technical).  A
    paragraph has been added after the sample package layout stating that there
    must be a file called__init__.py in a directory to make it a package.

    .mirrorinfo.  Fix by me to call string.lstrip(filename) to cope with a
    bug in strop.strip() in Python 1.4.  Additionally, I changed all print
    statements that print filenames etc. to put them in backquotes so that
    it will be more obvious when there's a funny character on one of them
    (such as a space...).

    as a dict.  Added default argument to groups() to specify what to
    return for unmatching groups; groupdict() also has this.

    Windows-specific hack to make sure that when LoadLibrary() is called,
    the filename contains at least a rudimentary pathname.
    (The bad part is that we need to call getcwd() because only a prefix

    Mac version of freeze. Uses standard freeze modules where it can,
    augmenting them here and there. For now, it works more-or-less similar
    to unix/windows freeze, generating a config.c file, but storing
    modules in PYC resources. A template project is also copied.
    
    The hooks are in place to freeze by merging shared libraries so you
    can freeze without a C compiler/linker, but this does not work yet.

    Removed loading of shared font stuff from howto.cls and manual.cls, moving it
    to pypaper.sty.
    
    Added the use of the "avant" package to use AvantGarde for the sans-serif
    font instead of the helvetica font loaded by the "times" package.

    Revert the change of revision 1.30.  While it's in general a laudable
    goal to use isinstance(x, y) instead of comparing type(x) to y, it
    doesn't make sense to change this in the example code for the type()
    builtin...

    Fix the tests for various anomalies in the string-to-numbers
    conversions.  Formerly, for example, int('-') would return 0 instead
    of raising ValueError, and int(' 0') would raise ValueError
    (complaining about a null byte!) instead of 0...

    Turns out that 'winfo id' returns the id as a hex string, with 0x prefix.
    The int() function (aliased to getint()) doesn't handle that, so we must
    use self.tk.getint() again...

    There was an error check in a loop in PythonCmd which called
    PythonCmd_Error() but failed to return.  The error wasn't very likely
    (only when we run out of memory) but since the check is there we might
    as well return the error.  (I think that Barry introduced this buglet
    when he added error checks everywhere.)

    Minor cleanup by Tim after my changes:
    
    + Took the "list" argument out of the other functions that no longer need
    it.  This speeds things up a little more.
    
    + Small comment changes in accord with that.
    
    + Exploited the now-safe ability to cache values in the partitioning loop.
    Makes no timing difference on my flavor of Pentium, but this machine ran out
    of registers 12 iterations ago.  It should yield a small speedup on a RISC
    machine, and not hurt in any case.

    Tim's latest, with some of my changes (also a TP suggestion) added:
    instead of testing whether the list changed size after each
    comparison, temporarily set the type of the list to an immutable list
    type.  This should allow continued use of the list for legitimate
    purposes but disallows all operations that can change it in any way.
    (Changes to the internals of list items are not caught, of cause;
    that's not possible to detect, and it's not necessary to protect the
    sort code, either.)

    # (My first checkin from Windows NT using remote CVS!)
    
    There were some serious problem with the thread-safety code.
    The basic problem was that often the result was gotten out of
    the Tcl interpreter object after releasing the Tcl lock.
    Of course, another thread might have changed the return value
    already, and this was indeed happening.  (Amazing what trying
    it on a different thread implementation does!)
    
    The solution is to grab the Python lock without releasing the
    Tcl lock, so it's safe to create a string object or set the
    exceptions from the Tcl interpreter.  Once that's done, the
    Tcl lock is released.
    
    Note that it's now legal to acquire the Python lock while the
    the Tcl lock is held; but the reverse is not true: the Python
    lock must be released before the Tcl lock is acquired.  This
    in order to avoid deadlines.  Fortunately, there don't seem to
    be any problems with this.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Jun 13 13:56:28 1998 +0000

    Fixed the EventHook() code so that it also works on Windows, sort of.
    (The "sort of" is because it uses kbhit() to detect that the user
    starts typing, and then no events are processed until they hit
    return.)
    
    Also fixed a nasty locking bug: EventHook() is called without the Tcl
    lock set, so it can't use the ENTER_PYTHON and LEAVE_PYTHON macros,
    which manipulate both the Python and the Tcl lock.  I now only acquire
    and release the Python lock.
    
    (Haven't tested this on Unix yet...)

Date:   Thu Jun 11 22:25:59 1998 +0000

    With the recent change that makes numbers compare smaller than anything,
    the outcome of the test for max has changed.

    Now that test_MimeWriter is untabified, do the same here!

    Oops, bug in release date!

commit cff311aa373c11756bbd353bfe77819f5d777598
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 11 14:06:59 1998 +0000

    Be more careful than the previous patch.  The default content-type
    should only be set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded when the
    method is POST.  E.g. for PUT, an empty default (defaulting to
    text/plain later) makes more sense.

commit e894fc0ea324b90e25ccd680aa4c908be6711555
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 11 13:58:40 1998 +0000

    Support new overridable method, isheader() (ESR).
    
    Also implement __setitem__(), more-or-less correctly (GvR).

commit 444d0f87c9e4de5082a92c658cc36843855b23b9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 11 13:50:02 1998 +0000

    Eric Raymond: added doc for isheader(); improved docs for constructor.

    Document the changes I just checked in.

commit c7bb8577c7ccc48fa1e1db0204ae280fb81b075d
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Jun 10 21:31:01 1998 +0000

    Some changes suggested/provided by Eric Raymond:
    
    - explain seekable
    - when seekable==1, test fp.tell() and set it to 0 if that fails
    - support overridable method iscomment(line) to weed out comments
    - check for unread() method on file object before trying to seek
    
    And one of my own:
    
    - Add a get() method which behaves like a dictionary's get(); this is
    actually implemented by giving getheader() an optional second argument
    to specify the default, and aliasing get to getheader.

Date:   Wed Jun 10 17:57:44 1998 +0000

    Document several variables that were previously undocumented,
    including the new __stdin__, __stdout__ and __stderr__.
    Also moved setttrace around to its proper place in the alphabet.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Jun 9 21:25:41 1998 +0000

    Added notes about epochs, the year 2038, and a small Y2K disclaimer
    (all with index entries!).  Also update the list of functions that
    take or yield a time represented as a 9-tuple.

commit dd47ec98e2030c51b78ddf18a5765cad8bdc642d
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Jun 9 19:49:16 1998 +0000

    Default content-type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded at the top
    level of a form.  This means that browsers that omit the content-type
    header when sending a POST command aren't penalized so heavily.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Jun 9 19:02:21 1998 +0000

    From: "Tim Peters" <tim_one@msn.com>
    
    The 1.5.1 tabnanny.py suffers an assert error if fed a script whose last
    line is both indented and lacks a newline:
    
    if 1:
        print 'oh fudge' # no newline here:
    
    The attached version repairs that.

    When comparing objects of different types (which is done by comparing
    the type names), make sure that numeric objects are considered smaller
    than all other objects, by forcing their name to "".

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Jun 8 20:27:29 1998 +0000

    When unmarshalling, add test for negative lengths on strings, tuples
    and lists; if the size is negative, raise an exception.  Also raise an
    exception when an undefined type is found -- all this to increase the
    chance that garbage input causes an exception instead of a core dump.

commit a63eff6e6aac8325cb3542a2d678cfc69fa8597e
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri May 29 21:37:21 1998 +0000

    Allow assignments to special class attributes -- with typechecks, and
    not in restricted mode.
    
    __dict__ can be set to any dictionary; the cl_getattr, cl_setattr and
    cl_delattr slots are refreshed.
    
    __name__ can be set to any string.
    
    __bases__ can be set to to a tuple of classes, provided they are not
    subclasses of the class whose attribute is being assigned.
    
    __getattr__, __setattr__ and __delattr__ can be set to anything, or
    deleted; the appropriate slot (cl_getattr, cl_setattr, cl_delattr) is
    refreshed.
    
    (Note: __name__ really doesn't need to be a special attribute, but
    that would be more work.)

    Tim's revision of the previous patch.  He also added some sparts to
    the median-of-three code to get a few percent back.

    Make gauss() semi-thread-safe.  It can still give duplicate results,
    but it can no longer raise an exception when called by several threads
    simultaneously.

    Fix bogus error return when open_osfhandle() doesn't have the right
    argument list.

Date:   Thu May 28 23:06:38 1998 +0000

    Changes to make it possible to write multi-threaded programs using
    Tkinter.  This adds a separate lock -- read the comments.  (This was
    also needed for Mark Hammond's attempts to make PythonWin
    Tkinter-friendly.)
    
    The changes have affected the EventHook slightly, too; and I've done
    some more cleanup of the code that deals with the different versions
    of Tcl_CreateFileHandler().

    Patch by Lars Marius Garshol:
    
    - Handle <? processing instructions >.
    
    - Allow . and - in entity names.
    
    Also fixed an oversight in the previous fix (in one place, [ \t\r\n]
    was used instead of string.whitespace).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu May 28 20:18:18 1998 +0000

    Some systems (e.g. Linux) use enums for some symbols (like IPPROTO_IP)
    so that our #ifdef test has the wrong effect.  Substitute hardcoded
    values for some important symbols (but not for the whole range -- some
    are pretty obscure so it's not worth it).

Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Thu May 28 14:22:48 1998 +0000

    For ControlWindow there is a new method do_rawcontrolhit(), which gets
    control before TrackControl is called. The default implementation
    calls TrackControl and then do_controlhit().
    
    For ScrolledWindow, do_rawcontrol passes a tracker function to
    TrackControl if the mouse is in one of the arrows or grey areas, and
    the tracker handles scrolling. For the thumb part nothing has changed.

    Allow an (optional) tracking function (or -1) to be specified to
    TrackControl. TrackControl is now manually generated (too much work to
    explain this to bgen).

    Subject: Buglet in PyLong_AsLong
    From: "Tim Peters" <tim_one@email.msn.com>

    Guido, the overflow checking in PyLong_AsLong is off a little:
    
    1) If the C in use sign-extends right shifts on signed longs, there's a
    spurious overflow error when converting the most-negative int:

    The attached should repair both, and, because I installed a new disk and a C
    compiler today, it's even been compiled this time <wink>.

    Use a different implementation of EventHook().  The new version
    registers an input file handler for stdin with Tcl and handles Tcl
    events until something is available on stdin; it then deletes the
    handler and returns from EventHook().
    
    This works with or without GNU readline, and doesn't busy-wait.
    
    It still doesn't work for Mac or Windows :-(

    Add an alias (and preferred name) "contains" for "sequenceIncludes".
    
    Rationalized the doc strings.
    
    Also simplify the module initialization -- we don't need a __version__
    which is set to "$Rev" :-) and we don't need a fatal error when the
    initialization fails.

    Moved cmp_member() to abstract.c, as PySequence_Contains() [with
    swapped arguments].
    
    Also make sure that no use of a function pointer gotten from a
    tp_as_sequence or tp_as_mapping structure is made without checking it
    for NULL first.

Date:   Fri May 22 00:51:39 1998 +0000

    A bunch of functions are now properly implemented in abstract.c, and
    the code here becomes much simpler.  In particular: abs(), divmod(),
    pow(), int(), long(), float(), len(), tuple(), list().
    
    Also make sure that no use of a function pointer gotten from a
    tp_as_sequence or tp_as_mapping structure is made without checking it
    for NULL first.
    
    A few other cosmetic things, such as properly reindenting slice().

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri May 22 00:47:05 1998 +0000

    Completely reformatted, standardizing indentation as well as
    programming style.
    
    Recoded many routines to incorporate better error checking, and/or
    better versions of the same function found elsewhere
    (e.g. bltinmodule.c or ceval.c).  In particular,
    Py_Number_{Int,Long,Float}() now convert from strings, just like the
    built-in functions int(), long() and float().
    
    Sequences and mappings are now safe to have NULL function pointers
    anywhere in their tp_as_sequence or tp_as_mapping fields.  (A few
    places in other files need to be checked in too.)
    
    Renamed PySequence_In() to PySequence_Contains().

    Trivial little change: when setting a member to an object, hold the
    old value in a temporary and XDECREF it only after then new value has
    been set.  This prevents the (unlikely) case where the destructor of
    the member uses the containing object -- it would find it in an
    undefined state.

    Fix a curious bug: statements like "import sys.time" would succeed,
    because the path through the code would notice that sys.__path__ did
    not exist and it would fall back to the default path (builtins +
    sys.path) instead of failing).  No longer.

    Hi all,
    browsing the reference manual I noticed what seem two small errors:
      a) in the list of keywords (section 2.3.1) 'exec' is missing
      b) in the Operator Precedence table (5.12) the comparison operators
         include '=', but probably '==' was intended.
    Hope this help,
    lele.

    To:      python-list@cwi.nl
    Subject: getargs bug in 1.2 and 1.3 BETA
    
    We have found a bug in the part of the getargs code that we added
    and submitted, and which was incorporated into 1.1.
    
    The parsing of "O?" format specifiers is not handled correctly;
    there is no "else" for the "if" and therefore it can never fail.
    What's worse, the advancing of the varargs pointer is not
    handled properly, so from then on it is out of sync, wreaking
    all sorts of havoc. (If it had failed properly, then the out-of-sync
    varargs would not have been an issue.)
    
    Below is the context diff for the change.
    
    Note that I have made a few stylistic changes beyond adding the
    else case, namely:
    
    1) Making the "O" case follow the convention established by the other
    format specifiers of getting all their vararg arguments before
    performing the test, rather than getting some before and some after
    the test passes.
    
    2) Making the logic of the tests parallel, so the "if" part indicates
    that the format is accepted and the "else" part indicates that the
    format has failed. They were inconsistent with each other and with the
    the other format specifiers.

    Change the output names.  Do away with the Release and Debug
    subdirectories.
    
    All final products go into the current directory (i.e., PCbuild).
    
    Object files go into temp-release and temp-debug.
    
    Debug versions of DLLs have _d appended to their basename, e.g. the
    debug version of python15.dll is python15_d.dll, the debug version of
    python.exe is python_d.exe, and the debug version of parser.pyd is
    parser_d.pyd.  (See corresponding patch to importdl.c.)  Uniformly
    changed all extension modules to use .pyd, not .dll.

    Date: 13 May 98 18:33:11 GMT
    
    I think I found a bug in CGIHTTPServer.py.  (Does anyone care? :-)
    I was trying to use it as the web server for uploading files.
    Python CGI scripts (using the CGI module) that worked for other
    servers (e.g., Netscape Enterprise server) hang when run from
    CGIHTTPServer.  The problem is that the content type parameters,
    in particular the boundary parameter, were not passed through to
    the CGI scripts, thus making the MIME parsing code choke.
    
    My simple-minded fix is:
    
            % diff CGIHTTPServer.py /usr/local/lib/python1.5/CGIHTTPServer.py
            137,140c136
            <           if self.headers.typeheader is None:
            <               env['CONTENT_TYPE'] = self.headers.type
            <           else:
            <               env['CONTENT_TYPE'] = self.headers.typeheader
            ---
            >           env['CONTENT_TYPE'] = self.headers.type

Date:   Tue May 12 14:59:24 1998 +0000

    New APIs to write to sys.stdout or sys.stderr using a printf-like interface.
    Adapted from code submitted by Just van Rossum.
    
       PySys_WriteStdout(format, ...)
       PySys_WriteStderr(format, ...)
    
          The first function writes to sys.stdout; the second to sys.stderr.  When
          there is a problem, they write to the real (C level) stdout or stderr;
          no exceptions are raised (but a pending exception may be cleared when a
          new exception is caught).
    
          Both take a printf-style format string as their first argument followed
          by a variable length argument list determined by the format string.
    
          *** WARNING ***
    
          The format should limit the total size of the formatted output string to
          1000 bytes.  In particular, this means that no unrestricted "%s" formats
          should occur; these should be limited using "%.<N>s where <N> is a
          decimal number calculated so that <N> plus the maximum size of other
          formatted text does not exceed 1000 bytes.  Also watch out for "%f",
          which can print hundreds of digits for very large numbers.

    In package Override, use the getcwd() function from the Cwd module instead of
    the one from Override.pm (part of latex2html).
    
    Absolutize the TEXINPUTS environment variable, since we can't count on
    latex2html doing it for us (even though I sent in a patch, and it really
    should).

    Implement round() slightly different, so that for negative ndigits no
    additional errors happen in the last step.  The trick is to avoid

    Fix by Sean Reifschneider:
      - When facility not specified to syslog() method, use default from openlog()
        (This is how it was claimed to work in the documentation)
      - Potential resource leak of o_ident, now cleaned up in closelog()
      - Minor comment accuracy fix.

    Added some new cruft.
    
    For some of the "big" targets, force things to happen in the "right"
    subdirectory, i.e., "make" will build the DVI and PostScript files in the
    paper-letter/ directory, and "make PAPER=a4" will build DVI and PostScript
    files in the paper-a4/ directory.
    
    Probably still needs some restructuring.

    Support the new directory structure.
    
    Some targets may be a little raw, but the basic formatting targets are all
    tested, primarily for use from the subdirs.  There are probably a few
    gotchas, and the paper-*/ directories could use "helper" Makefiles.

    New helper script to build the .dvi for a Python manual; usable for the
    api, ext, ref, and tut manuals.  The Library Reference requires too much
    special index processing to make it beneficial to extend this to support
    it.

    When a file name is selected ("OK" button, <Return> in the filename entry),
    and the "key" keyword parameter was used to invoke .go(), use the directory
    of the selected file as the stored directory to return to when the same key
    is used again.  This is useful since the user may well entry at least part
    of the path in the filename box instead of doing a lot of clicking around in
    the listboxes.

    Change the names of all methods in the Wm class: they are now
    wm_title(), etc.  The old names (title() etc.) are still defined as
    aliases.
    
    This brings all methods up to use the same naming convention: whether
    the Tcl syntax is
    
       .window.path.name command subcommand [options]
    
    or
    
       command subcommand .window.path.name [optins]
    
    the Python equivalent is always
    
       windowobject.command_subcommand(options)

    Use (void) to throw away a function result, not (void *) !

commit 0132f69c2ef8bcc49cf30c955ac5cc215eea50a0
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

    Another optimization, probably of negligeable effect: instead of
    calling self.tk.getint() and self.tk.getdouble(), call the globals
    getint() and getdouble(), which in turn are just names for the Python
    builtins int() and double().  (Making them globals actually save a
    dict lookup compared to using the built-in.)  The corresponding
    methods of class Misc have been changed similarly.  (Note that
    getboolean() hasn't been changed because there's no Python
    equivalent.)
    
    The use of int() and float() has another advantage: if/when Tcl calls
    can actually return Tcl objects with other types than string, use of
    int() and float() is essential.

    Save a tiny bit of time: self.tk.call takes a tuple argument so it's
    not needed to say apply(self.tk.call, t); self.tk.call(t) has the same
    effect.  This cuts down tremendously on the number of apply() calls
    made.  No measurable effect, but at the very least it saves the lookup
    of apply() in the globals!

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 29 16:22:14 1998 +0000

    Still somewhat experimental speedup.  This appears to speed up the
    most common interface to Tcl, the call() method, by maybe 20-25%.
    
    The speedup code avoids the construction of a Tcl command string from
    the argument list -- the Tcl argument list is immediately parsed back
    by Tcl_Eval() into a list that is *guaranteed* (by Tcl_Merge()) to be
    exactly the same list, so instead we look up the command info and call
    the command function directly.  If the lookup fails, we fall back to
    the old method (Tcl_Merge() + Tcl_Eval()) so we don't need to worry
    about special cases like undefined commands or the occasional command
    ("after") that sets the info.proc pointer to NULL -- let TclEval()
    deal with these.

    Add a new method of interpreter objects, interpaddr().  This returns
    the address of the Tcl interpreter object, as an integer.  Not very
    useful for the Python programmer, but this can be called by another C
    extension that needs to make calls into the Tcl/Tk C API and needs to
    get the address of the Tcl interpreter object.  A simple cast of the
    return value to (Tcl_Interp *) will do the trick now.

    Document changed semantics -- open() now guesses the db type and error
    is now a tuple of various and sundry exceptions.

    Oops, I had 'n' and 'c' mixed up in my mind.  Get rid of the comment
    that wonders what the difference is and explain them properly.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Apr 28 15:19:34 1998 +0000

    Inspired by Ben Sayer, rewritten the code and some of the comments to
    be more intelligent when the database already exists (use the module
    for the existing file, according to whichdb).  Noted in the doc
    strings that there doesn't seem to be a different between 'c' and 'n'.

    When setting the event structure fields, don't die when the widget
    name is not registered; simply use the string.  This happens for
    tear-off widgets (e.g. if you've registered enter/leave events for the
    menu).

    Instead of calling mktime(), which has all sorts of unwanted side
    effects, simply zero out the struct tm buffer before using it; this
    should take care of the BSD folks' concern just as well.

    Paper size / font size configuration file.
    
    This is separated so I can build A4 and US Letter sizes without having to
    edit files.
    
    Anyone who downloads the source package can also simply edit this file,
    which is a lot shorter than the manual.cls file, and easier to find the
    appropriate line.

    Grmpf, a lot more routines have gotten a "Mac" prefix for their
    declaration, probably so the universal headers are useable on
    windows/unix too. Have to think of a more definite workaround later,
    for now we manually declare the old names in the *edit.py files.

    In-line the code in range() to set the list items; there's really no
    need to call PyList_SetItem(v,i,w) when PyList_GET_ITEM(v,i)=w {sic}

    Freeze assumes that all built-in modules are part of the Python core.
    This is not necessarily the case.  It is possible to create a Python
    binary which contains built-in extension modules.  Therefore
    checkextensions should be used for all unknown and builtin modules.

    When using extention modules, relative path names that occur in the

    Added support for the horribly complex TimeRecord, so we can position
    movies, etc. TimeBase objects have also been slightly modified for
    this (for instance: the DisposeTimeBase call shouldn't be done in the
    __del__ routine, the timebase might belong to someone else).

    If there's no comment for an error we use the symbolic name as the
    error message. Not really fantastic, but "reqAborted" is better than
    "MacOS error -1105" at least.

    work because the finder got there first (at leats, that's what I think
    happened).

    Fix the broken PDF links, really this time!

    beta -- if there are bugs, I'll post a patch page and release 1.5.2
    sooner.)

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 9 23:28:20 1998 +0000

    Quick and extremely dirty hacks to toggle between using CPython and
    JPython interpreters.  This implementation may suck.
    
    (py-jpython-command, py-jpython-command-args): New variables.
    
    (py-mode-map): py-toggle-shells bound to C-c C-t
    
    (py-toggle-shells): Command to toggle between using CPython (the
    default) and JPython.  This is buffer local, and notice the mode-name
    change.
    
    (py-shell): Use either CPython or JPython.  Note that py-execute-*
    still needs to be modified.

    Another new utility: getpass() prompts for a password, with echo off.
    Also contains getuser(), which returns the username (not prompting though).
    These work on Unix and Windows!

    Don't use \samp when \code is better.
    
    Consistently use ' instead of ":  this conforms to my unofficial stance that
    constants should be presented using the repr() whenever it makes sense.  This
    isn't because I think repr() is the greatest thing since spam, just that it's
    an easy to adopt consistency standard.  (It also holds no new surprises!)

    Work around a small (& annoying) limitation of the latex2html support for
    \seemodule.  This is far easier than figuring out the real problem, but it
    works.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 9 15:41:44 1998 +0000

    Removed misleading comment about GNU software.  This module and the zlib
    library have no relationship with GNU software other than implementing some of
    the same algorithms and file format.  (The zlib module is more general.)

Date:   Thu Apr 9 14:32:28 1998 +0000

    Don't assume that \version expands to the 3-character major.minor number; it
    is the full release version name ("1.5.1beta1", for instance).
    
    Add section for previously documented obsolete modules.  Includes ni, rand,
    and soundex.

    When getcwd() doesn't exist or raises an exception, don't fail but
    fall back to using os.curdir instead; if it is fine, don't use
    os.curdir at all.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 8 23:12:51 1998 +0000

    Nearly a complete re-write.
    
    Basically, it now works and produces a nice-looking HTML index.
    
    Shows some promise for extensibility, but still young.  Needs useful comments.

commit 166abbabf9eb2c5198abc37a783d5d6a007742c3
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 8 23:10:54 1998 +0000

    Remove option to strip out <tt>...</tt> from index entry text; this is now
    left to the buildindex.py script.
    
    Change the field separator used in the index.dat file so utilities like grep
    are useful on these files; they can't typically handle NUL bytes.
    
    Protect index entries for environment variables from being handled as
    case-insensitive by buildindex.py.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 8 13:46:24 1998 +0000

    Set flag to remove <tt>...</tt> markup from the index entries; it just ends up
    looking really bad in popular browsers, mostly due to vertical size differences
    between the roman and monospaced fonts.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>

    Separate sections on anydbm and dumbdbm.
    
    This is the last separation; each module now gets its own section.  This will
    be useful in performing conversions.

    Normalized case rules in section headings.

    This means there's now a short section on "Defining Functions" immediately

commit 58b2bfd0bfeaad6bc0f0b7d4d0af6fd7194e3c3d
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 2 20:14:04 1998 +0000

    This fixes a (minor) problem discovered by AMK when you don't want any
    special markup for the first column of a table using {tableii} or {tableiii}.
    In LaTeX, this requires using "textrm" as the formatting function, and this
    is needed to remove the bogus "<textrm>" that gets generated otherwise.
    There should probably be a more general mapping of specified markup to useful
    markup, but that doesn't appear needed at the moment.
    
    do_env_tableii(), do_env_tableiii():  If the markup for the first column is
            \textrm, make it empty.
    
    do_cmd_lineii(), do_cmd_lineiii():  If the markup for the first column is
            empty, don't add markup around the text.

    Be more specific about where in RFC 1421 to look, since it's not at all
    obvious when taking a quick look.
    
    Say "base64" instead of "base-64", since that seems to be how it's referred
    to in other RFCs.

    Added one index entry.
    
    Fix include file reference in "Shared Libraries" to print <...> instead of

    Markup consistency & nits.
    
    Fix typo in a C code example:  KeyError is spelled PyExc_KeyError in C; the
    "K" is upper case!
    
    Some index entries.
    
    On function signatures, always use parameter names.  Make return types match
    what's in the header files.  When the return type is a pointer, always omit
    the space between te type name and the "*"; leaving it in results in
    
            type * func(..)
    
    and having two spaces there just looks terrible.

    (py-compute-indentation): When looking at a continuation line inside
    an open paren, do a better job of reindenting the line.  For example:
    
    def foo():
        print 'hello %s, %d' % (
        a, b)
    
    Hit TAB on the line starting with `a'.  Without this patch this line
    will never be reindented.

    Two patches for Emacs 20.2 compatibility:
    
    (py-compute-indentation): int-to-char isn't defined in Emacs, but we
    don't really need it anyway, so just remove this conversion.  XEmacs
    is happy either way.
    
    (py-parse-state): The Emacs branch (i.e. w/o buffer-syntactic-context)
    wasn't adjusting point correctly.

    Don't write "if self.dict: self.dict.close()"; just write
    "self.dict.close()" and ignore the exception.  The "if self.dict:"

    (py-postprocess-output-buffer): Return t if an exception was found,
    otherwise return nil.
    
    (py-execute-region): When executing the buffer asynchronously in a
    subprocess, if an exception occurred, show both the output buffer and
    the file containing the exception, leaving point on the source line
    containing bottom-most error in the traceback.  If no exception
    occurred, jump to the output buffer (no change).

    Removed all the mixed indentation face stuff.  It's not as helpful as
    it at first seems.  I think we've got a good idea of what to do, but
    it'll be a bit of work... for later.

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 20 14:48:30 1998 +0000

    (py-tab-face): => py-mixed-indentation-face
    
    (python-font-lock-keywords): Better regexp given by Sjoerd.  This
    matches only mixed indentation which is probably more useful than
    matching all tabs.

    (py-in-literal, py-fast-in-literal): New functions (mostly) stolen
    from CC Mode.
    
    (py-guess-indent-offset): Teach it about colons in `literals'
    (e.g. comments and strings).  Don't false hit colons in literals; keep
    searching for a real block introducing line.

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 19 21:52:06 1998 +0000

    (py-tab-face, python-font-lock-keywords): Color all tabs at the start
    of a line in py-tab-face to aid in seeing mixed tab/space indentation.
    This face defaults to the `default' face so it is unobtrusive until
    you `M-x customize-face' py-tab-face to something obnoxious like
    "Yellow".

    Reverting some the index stuff to use tools/newind.py again; this works
    better with LaTeX2HTML.
    
    Run pdflatex twice to generate the PDF files, even though LaTeX has already
    been run a couple of times.  This ensures that font metrics for the final
    run match those for the first run, and seesm to get (somewhat) better
    outline results.

    (python-mode): After python-mode-hook is run, do the automagic
    calculation if py-smart-indentation is non-nil.
    
    (py-parse-state): Get rid of unused variable to quiet the
    byte-compiler.

commit 371ecc0c1be0847862a67ffe4ca33fe0174ee986
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 12 06:44:58 1998 +0000

    Use \withsubitem{} for indexing functions from other modules.  This fixes
    things in the index.

commit 0ee9f727c9e4437d615f6f5877d9f0383d99e726
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 12 06:41:40 1998 +0000

    \withsubitem{}:  New macro.  Change indexsubitem temporarily for another
            macro.  Intended usage:
    
                    \withsubitem{(in module foo)}{\ttindex{myfunc()}}
    
            This allows indexing functions from other modules/class/whatnot
            without being dependent on the exact expansions of several macros
            internal to python.sty.  It's also easier to read in the source!
    
    Some new "logical" macros that seem to be useful:
    
    \regexp{}:  For regular expressions.  To make it easier to keep the appearance
            consistent.
    
    \mimetype{}:  Don't use \code{}!
    
    \envvar{}:  Environment variable.  This does some indexing as well.
    
    \character{}:  Just a character we want to talk about in the text, but not
            a Python constant.

    *Sigh*
    
    Add a -q option for "quiet" operation.  Nothing gets out (not even stderr,
    since that's tossed to stdout for capture in the .how file).  It's a good
    idea to use -l to get the log in case there are problems.  Maybe this should
    be the default and add a --verbose option to get the stdout?  There's way
    too much junk output.

    After compression, these last two account for about one-half MB, and half

    needed.

    Note -- the HTML generation using webmaker is currently broken.  I'll
    have to look into generating HTML from Frame...

    Support for frozen packages, matching the revamped Tools/freeze.
    Frozen packages are indicated by a negative size (the code string
    is the __import__.py file).  A frozen package module has its __path__
    set to a string, the package name.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 5 03:42:00 1998 +0000

    Added support for packages.
    We have a whole new module finder that uses the actual Python
    parser and scans the bytecode for IMPORT_NAME and IMPORT_FROM.
    This requires some support in import.c (that hasn't been checked in).
    New command line options for this: -d, -q, -m.

    changeit():  Added support for \deprecated{}.
    
    Chunk.__repr__(), main():  Allow Chunk objects to get the buffer, to make the
    representation contain text instead of a pair of indexes.  This makes debugging
    a little easier.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 4 05:36:59 1998 +0000

    Preliminary LaTeX2HTML 98.1p1 support.  Includes patch from Ross Moore to
    get some funky quoting of ']' in \item[...] to work right without having to
    do really ugly things to the documents themselves.
    
    There are a lot of things relating to indexing that are commented out;
    parts need to be examined and dealt with with respect to changes in
    LaTeX2HTML internals.  I'll work with Ross to see what it takes to make
    this sort of stuff reasonable.

commit 2da947af878842ab8676e48a26d1aeb25c082e3e
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 4 05:30:49 1998 +0000

    Comment out the attempt to get index-related stuff processed in the right
    order.  LaTeX2HTML just doesn't do things the same way as LaTeX, and this
    wasn't the fix.
    
    Simplify the generated HTML for \file{}.

    Perish Evil Revelry and Lamentation.

commit 75acc9ca1c2415717951ac11347714563894b325
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 3 22:26:50 1998 +0000

    Add a single Python-wide (!) lock on import.  Only one thread at a
    time can be in PyImport_ImportModuleEx().  Recursive calls from the
    same thread are okay.
    
    Potential problems:
    
    - The lock should really be part of the interpreter state rather than
    global, but that would require modifying more files, and I first want
    to figure out whether this works at all.
    
    - One could argue that the lock should be per module -- however that
    would be complicated to implement.  We would have to have a linked
    list of locks per module name, *or* invent a new object type to
    represent a lock, so we can store the locks in the module or in a
    separate dictionary.  Both seem unwarranted.  The one situation where
    this can cause problems is when loading a module takes a long time,
    e.g. when the module's initialization code interacts with the user --
    during that time, no other threads can run.  I say, "too bad."

    Convert LaTeX support to create a new class of documents.  HTML generation
    now requires LaTeX2HTML 98.1p1 or newer (& and is still in progress).
    
    This means that doing things to change the formatting of the manuals (at the
    "normal user" level, like A4 paper), can happen in just one place, rather
    than in each document file.

commit 4f56f2d64668b37f8b36545dee3960f10047af28
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Feb 27 14:54:06 1998 +0000

    When "declaring" a module using \*modindex{}, and * doesn't start with "ref",
    set up the indexsubitem to "(in module #1)" automatically.  This reduces the
    amount of markup needed in the module docs and, more importantly, makes it
    o.k. to leave out in simple sections.  \setindexsubitem{} can still be used
    to change or reset it.

    Move code for \b@code, \e@code into the macros for the verbatim environment
    directly since they're not used elsewhere.
    
    Derive the name of the modules .idx from the jobname.

    Add support for hyperref package.  This builds the PDF outline, makes the ToC
    and index "hot", etc.
    
    Updated a comment about fncychap.
    
    Removed unused minitoc support; I'm not going to use it.  Something that makes
    more sense with the Python lib ref can be done with reasonable effort, and can
    wait a little while.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Sun Feb 22 19:47:13 1998 +0000

    Changed way *.ind are forced to exist; the files are now reset to contain
    an empty index instead of touched.  Note that for modindex.ind, this also
    includes "\label{modindex}" so that the modindex.py script doesn't change
    the set of labels in the document.
    
    Be more consistent in use of $* in commands.

    Adapt to new webchecker structure.  Due to better structure of
    getpage(), much less duplicate code is needed -- we only need to
    override readhtml().

Date:   Sat Feb 21 20:02:09 1998 +0000

    Major overhaul.  Don't use global variable (e.g. verbose); use
    instance variables.  Make all global functions methods, for easy
    overriding.  Restructure getpage() for easy overriding.  Add
    save_pickle() method and load_pickle() global function to make it
    easier for other programs to emulate the toplevel interface.

    Regenerated from Universal Headers 3.0.1. Some new calls are
    blacklisted, because they are not available in classic 68k programs,
    and bgen doesn't have a way to put #ifdef/#endif in the generated
    code. For now we only implement calls that work on all three models.

    Fixed a bug in the gauss() function.  The bug was reported by Mike
    Miller, who complained that its kurtosis was bad, and then fixed by
    Lambert Meertens (author of the original algorithm) who discovered
    that the mathematical analysis leading to his solution was wrong, and
    provided a corrected version.  Mike then tested the fix and reported
    that the kurtosis was now good.

    Jeff Kunce writes (and he is right):
    
    Also, I just ran across a [possible] minor glitch
    in the library documentation for site.py. It says:
    
    "For example, suppose sys.prefix and
    sys.exec_prefix are set to `/usr/local'. The
    Python 1.5 library is then installed in
    `/usr/local/lib/python1.5'. Suppose this has a
    subdirectory `/usr/local/python1.5/site-packages'
    with three subsubdirectories, `foo', `bar' and

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 19 20:58:44 1998 +0000

    Moved clear_carefully() to _PyModule_Clear() in moduleobject.c
    (modified) and use that.
    
    Some differences in the cleanup algorithm:
    
    - Clear __main__ before the other modules.
    
    - Delete more sys variables: including ps1, ps2, exitfunc, argv, and
    even path -- this will prevent new imports!
    
    - Restore stdin, stdout, stderr from __stdin__, __stdout__,
    __stderr__, effectively deleting hooks that the user might have
    installed -- so their (the hooks') destructors will run.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 19 20:53:06 1998 +0000

    Make backup copies of stdin, stdout, stderr as __stdin__, __stdout__,
    __stderr__.  These will be used by the import cleanup.

commit f1dc0615e913fd0028a2fa6fda9607b3edfa76d5
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 19 20:51:52 1998 +0000

    Add internal routine _PyModule_Clear(), which does approximately what
    clear_carefully() used to do in import.c.  Differences: leave only
    __builtins__ alone in the 2nd pass; and don't clear the dictionary (on
    the theory that as long as there are references left to the
    dictionary, those might be destructors that might expect __builtins__
    to be alive when they run; and __builtins__ can't normally be part of
    a cycle).

    Vladimir Marangozov' performance hack: copy f_builtins from ancestor
    if the globals are the same.
    
    Also, when creating a dummy builtins dictionary, add "None" to it,
    just to be kind.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 19 06:23:06 1998 +0000

    Mostly LaTeX style cleanup.
    
    Use \newenvironment{envname} instead of \newcommand{\foo} &
    \newcommand{\endfoo} (or \let\endfoo=...!) wherever reasonable.
    
    Where {*desc} environment helper functions are not needed outside a
    single environment definition, inline them.
    
    Ensure that \seemodule{} and \seetext{} are only available within the
    {seealso} environment.
    
    Added "()" to the index entries for {funcdesc} and {cfuncdesc} environments.
    
    Added {classdesc} environment which looks like the {funcdesc} environment
    but doesn't add the parens in the index entry.

    &do_cmd_url,
    &do_cmd_email:  Adjust to use a font similar to that used in the printed
            representation.
    
    &my_module_index_helper:  Change to be only used for defining markup.  Don't
            prepend an <A NAME=...> to the result; use the containing page as
            the module target for the index.
    
    &ref_module_index_helper:  New function.  Used only for references to modules
            described elsewhere.  Generate the right target.
    
    &init_myformat:  Set the anchor_mark to an empty string; this avoids junky
            "&#160;"'s in the text, which could really screw up vertical spacing
            when that's all that's in a paragraph.
    
    &do_cmd_seemodule:  Insert markup to jump right to the referred-to module.

    l2hlib:  Added commands to translate node*.html to use the \label{} stuff,

    __modified(): Make sure `rgbs' is a tuple

commit f67a50c2e1b1afffd2ce49d4e53356e95a0efea0
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Feb 18 00:05:59 1998 +0000

    Several optimizations:
    
        self.__chips now contains the list of rgbtuple values for the
        chips named i - 1 (Tkinter counts from 1, we count from zero).
        The chip number was just the index + 1.  This means color lookup
        need not do an itemcget(), it can just index into __chips.
    
        instead of calling __canvas.itemconfigure(), we glom up a huge Tcl
        script and call tk.eval() directly.  Actually we do many appends
        to a Python list, then string.join() them together into one huge
        string.  This reduces the overhead of Tkinter but making one fast
        call to Tcl.

    Cache conversions from triplets to rrggbb's and vice versa.  Wasteful

Date:   Tue Feb 17 20:31:08 1998 +0000

    Added comment explaining the only warning produced by makeindex, since there
    doesn't appear to be a way to fix that's reasonable.

commit 326e19700ff05b6c8e46c3977778fb5ea627af2f

Date:   Tue Feb 17 20:14:12 1998 +0000

    Remove Macintosh ligatures item.  Solution:  Update your Times fonts.
    
    Added native package semantics note.

    Started a TODO list with the latest bug reports.
    
    In part prompted by questions from AMK.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Tue Feb 17 15:45:25 1998 +0000

    Added all-formats target:  use this to get both PDF and PS files; using the
    "alternate" rules for PDF generation doesn't ensure the PS files get
    generated since distiller isn't used.
    
    Switch to the "alternate" rules for PDF generation; this is starting to make
    more sense than the distiller-based rule, and requires only free software.
    I'm also confident it's working well (meaning I paged through all four
    pdflatex-generated PDF files).

Date:   Tue Feb 17 05:54:46 1998 +0000

    Massive changes.  Fewer warnings from the Python Library Reference.  Still
    messy, but the thing seems to be working without bombing completely today.
    Formatting lib.texi with TeX doesn't seem to do too badly, either!
    
    Info formatting isn't quite there; that might just have to disappear this
    time.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 16 22:30:10 1998 +0000

    Move optional package inclusions to the top, to make them easier to find.
    Code elsewhere in this file tests for the inclusion of the package and does
    not need to be uncommented.  Comments explain what they do and how to
    disable them.
    
    Added support for the optional "fancyhdr" package.  If used, page footers
    include chapter information on the left and section information on the right.
    
    Both optional packages, "fancyhdr" and "times", are enabled by default.  We
    may want to disable them before shipping, but I'm not completely convinced.
    (How many installations format their own documentation?)

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 16 22:18:00 1998 +0000

    Swap two statements in the dedent check loop.  This makes absolutely
    no difference, but avoids triggering an optimizer bug in the AIX
    compiler where the loop unrolling does the wrong thing...

    Made the area for wildcards in the description wider, so we don't invade the
    left margin.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>

    In the example file name, use the current Python version, not a hardcoded
    value.
    
    Use logical markup.

    For the lists which describe the regular expression syntax, increase the
    width available so we don't run into the left page margin.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 16 20:58:58 1998 +0000

    Use \version to get the current Python version number, where possible.  This
    can only be done in the running text, and not in {verbatim} environments.

    Added rule to generate the PDF format using pdflatex.  Commented out since
    this is still experimental software.  See the comment.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 16 15:42:50 1998 +0000

    Fixed the bug in searching for triple quotes -- change the 'quote2'
    variable from a pointer to an index, so a realloc() of the buffer
    won't disturb it.  Problem found by Vladimir Marangozov.

commit 9d20ac36a9eaee175955b00a2d582480e4b9c66f
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 16 15:27:08 1998 +0000

    Removed various "(New in 1.5a?!)" constructs.  Other notes pertaining to
    versioning remain intact.

    First, the RNG in whrandom.py sucks if you let it seed itself from the time.
    The problem is the line:
                            t = int((t&0xffffff) | (t>>24))
    Since it ORs the two parts together, the resulting value has mostly
    ON bits.  Change | to ^, and you don't lose any randomness.

    Place C typedef for Py_complex after brief description, to be more consistent
    with the other example of a structure description (struct _frozen).
    
    Added index entries for the modules referenced in the document.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 16 06:15:35 1998 +0000

    Lots of nitty-gritty stuff:
    
    Use \emph{} when referring to title of any of the Python manuals, like is
    done in the other manuals.
    
    In some places, use \emph{} or \dfn{} instead of ``...''.
    
    Use \samp{} instead of \code{} when marking identifier prefixes.
    
    Use logical markup wherever it made sense.
    
    Fixed a bunch of typos.
    
    In several places, use "---" instead of "--" to get the emdash.
    
    Start sentences with capital letters and end them with periods, as needed.
    
    "it's" --> "its" in many places:  "it's" it *always* a contraction of "it is",
    and "its" should always be used for the possessive.
    
    "don't" --> "doesn't"
    
    "should discards any" --> "should discard any"
    
    In C function descriptions, use \var{} to mark parameters in the running
    text instead of \code{}.  This matches usage in the other manauls better,
    and is more consistent with the formatting of the function signatures.
    Lots of little changes to implement this.
    
    Lots of fixups needed due to appearant heavy cut-&-paste in the orignal
    document.
    
    Mention that the exception objects may be either classes or strings,
    depending on the use of -X; they were unequivocally stated to be strings
    in the section "Standard Exceptions".
    
    "mkvalue()" --> "Py_BuildValue()"
    
    Description of PyNumber_Power() indicates that the third value is option,
    but not how to indicate that it was omitted.  Clarified.
    
    Explain the behavior of PyString_FromStringAndSize() if the buffer is NULL.
    
    Explain the Py_complex structure a little (tell what it's used for) and use
    a {verbatim} environment for the structure definition itself.
    
    Fix explanation of PyFile_SoftSpace().
    
    Update the example version string to 1.5.
    
    Combined the sections on defining new object types.

    Change {datadesc} environments with empty descriptions to \dataline{}s; this
    removes extra vertical space from the list of names, and makes the display
    more similar to that used in the socket module, where several constants share
    a description.

    In description of sound_similar(), break up the markup for long
    \code{} at each embedded space, so that the words will wrap.  This keeps
    it from being too ugly.

    In description of __import__, second paragraph, break up the markup for long
    \code{} at each embedded space, so that the words will wrap.  This keeps it
    from running off the side of the page, and is only slightly weird.

    Minor stuff:
    
    Explain what happens when a negative shift count is used (what exception).
    
    Mark the title "Python Reference Manual" as \emph{}, for consistency.
    
    "info" --> "information"
    
    Tell more about the data attributes of file objects, using the {datadesc}
    environment.
    
    When refering the user to the language reference for information about
    internal types, tell what internal types to expect information on.

    Add case checking feature on import.
    
    This is an option for OS-es with case-insensitive but case-preserving
    filesystems.  It is currently supported for Win32 and MacOS.  To
    enable it, #define CHECK_IMPORT_CASE in your platform specific
    config.h.  It is enabled by default on those systems where it is
    supported.  On Win32, it can be disabled at runtime by setting the
    environment variable PYTHONCASEOK (to any value).
    
    When enabled, the feature checks that the case of the requested module
    name matches that of the filename found in the filesystem, and raises
    a NameError exception when they don't match.

    &do_env_datadescni,
    &do_env_funcdescni:  New functions.  These support the non-indexing variety
            of the {datadesc} and {funcdesc} environments.
    
    There's still some flakiness with the new indexsubitem support, but that's
    low priority.

    Use "\samp{...}" instead of "``\code{...}''" when showing markup fragments
    in the running text.
    
    For computed attribute and method names (where there's a \var{} part to
    the name), use the non-indexing forms of \datadesc{} and \funcdesc{}.
    This doesn't change the printed output, but removes 3 rejections from the
    makeindex run and allows the LaTeX2HTML support to exclude these from the
    index.

    Two new environments:  datadescni and funcdescni.  These are similar to
    datadesc and funcdesc, but don't add entries to the index.

            \setindexsubitem{(...)}.
    
    &do_env_opcodedesc:  By default, don't index byte codes.
    
    $INDEX_OPCODES:  New flag.  If true, index the byte codes.  Default is off.
    
    Normalize indentation to 4 spaces everywhere.
    
    Minor nits.

    Change "\renewcommand{\indexsubitem}{(...)}" to "\setindexsubitem{(...)}"

Date:   Fri Feb 13 06:48:05 1998 +0000

    Lots of stuff:
    
    Handle most (all?) of the page style / numbering magic here so the documents
    don't have to do it individually.
    
    Revise the \bcode / \ecode stuff so that the {verbatim} environment handles
    it right directly.  \bcode / \ecode will be completely removed from all files
    (to be checked in momentarily).
    
    Have the {verbatim} environment get the samples indented a bit; this
    appearantly had been attempted in the old code, but didn't work because
    paragraphs weren't indented.
    
    Make all headers, from chapters on down to subparagraphs, have sans-serif
    titles.
    
    \setindexsubitem{}:  New macro.  Replaces \renewcommand{\indexsubitem{}(...)}
            everywhere.  This allows LaTeX2HTML to be made to work correctly for
            this.  That was near impossible with the old mechanisms.
    
    For all {*desc} environments, make the name of the described thing bold as
    well as monospaced.
    
    {opcodedesc} environment:  Don't index the byte code names; that doesn't seem
            terribly useful, and there are a lot of them.
    
    \var{}:  More magic to make sure that the size is right even if embedded in
            \file{} or some other macro that uses the sans-serif font in running
            text.
    
    \bfcode{}:  New macro.  Makes the font \code{} and bold.  (Was unreasonable
            using old LaTeX 2.09.)
    
    \file{}:  Adjust the size of the sans-serif font a little.
    
    \email{}, \url{},  Make these use the same font as \file{}, but not the
            surrounding single-quotes.
    
    Update many comments.
    
    Lots of minor nits and a little cleanliness.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Feb 13 01:39:16 1998 +0000

    Fix a horrible race condition -- various routines were storing the
    most recently opened URL in self.openedurl of the URLopener instance.
    This doesn't really work if multiple threads share the same opener
    instance!
    
    Fix: openedurl was actually simply the type prefix (e.g. "http:")
    followed by the rest of the URL; since the rest of the URL is
    available and the type is effectively determined by where you are in
    the code, I can reconstruct the full URL easily, e.g. "http:" + url.

Date:   Thu Feb 12 16:52:14 1998 +0000

    (py-compute-indentation): Several changes made to improve navigation
    over and around triple-quoted strings:
    
        - move the beginning-of-line to above the p-p-s call
    
        - in the `t' clause of the big cond, where we skip over
          triple-quoted strings, first find out if we're looking at a
          single or TQS, then skip over it in one fell swoop, instead of
          trying to loop over skipage of SQS's.
    
    (py-parse-state): Implement XEmacs only hack to more accurately figure
    out whether we're in a string or not.  Can't do this in Emacs because
    it lacks the necessary primitive, so we just do it the old (and mostly
    accurate, but foolable) way for Emacs.

    Script to fix up the Library Reference index so it's less ugly.  The docstring:
    
    """Combine similar index entries into an entry and subentries.
    
    For example:
    
      \item {foobar} (in module flotz), 23
      \item {foobar} (in module whackit), 4323
    
    becomes
    
      \item {foobar}
        \subitem in module flotz, 23
        \subitem in module whackit, 4323
    
    Note that an item which matches the format of a collapsable item but which
    isn't part of a group of similar items is not modified.
    """
    
    This results in a much more readable index, with less repitition of text;
    especially for common method names.

    Consistently use \POSIX{} to denote POSIX.  There were at least two different
    ways to do it previously (not counting module names).

    macro to insert an RFC index reference.
    
    (RFC references were formatted three different ways.)

    \itembreak, \itemjoin:  Remove unused macros.
    
    \idxcode{}:  New macro; used to mark things that would be \code{} for entry
            into the index.  This allows easily switching things around for the
            font used in the index.  (O'Reilly seems to keep it all plain roman
            in the index.  Looks reasonable in the Python documentation as well.)
    
    \*index{}:  Use \idxcode{} instead of {\codefont{}}.

    - Add Py_GetPythonHome() and Py_SetPythonHome(), intended to allow
    embedders to force a different PYTHONHOME.
    
    - Add new interface PyErr_PrintEx(flag); same as PyErr_Print() but
    flag determines whether sys.last_* are set or not.  PyErr_Print()
    now simply calls PyErr_PrintEx(1).

    of "variable": each individual variable should be identified as a single
    variable and not a collection in the index.

    Two more refinements of the cleanup process.
    
    (1) Explicitly clear __builtin__._ and sys.{last,exc}_* before
    clearing anything else.  These are common places where user values
    hide and people complain when their destructors fail.  Since the
    modules containing them are deleted *last* of all, they would come too
    late in the normal destruction order.  Sigh.
    
    (2) Add some debugging aid to cleanup (after a suggestion by Marc
    Lemburg) -- print the names of the modules being cleaned, and (when
    -vv is used) print the names of the variables being cleared.

    (py-parse-state): When looking for landing inside triple-quoted
    string, don't check for indentation at column zero.  This will falsely
    hit a line inside a docstring that starts at column zero but ends in a
    colon.

    New version of xmllib from Sjoerd.
    The main incompatibility is that the error reporting method is now
    called as
     parser.syntax_error(msg)
    instead of
     parser.syntax_error(lineno, msg)
    
    This new version also has some code to deal with the <?xml?> and
    <!DOCTYPE> tags at the start of an XML document.
    The documentation has been updated, and a small test module has been
    created.

    (This fix is really by Jeremy)
    
    Here's my suggested replacement for gzip.py for 1.5.1.  I've
    re-implemeted methods readline and readlines, added an _unread, and
    tweaked read and _read.
    
    I tried a more complicated buffer scheme for unread (using a list of
    strings and string.join), but it was more complicated and slower.
    This version is a lot faster than the current version and is still
    pretty simple.

    Unpickler.load_inst(), Unpickler.load_obj(), Unpickler.load_build():
    Fixed problems when unpickling in restricted execution environments.
    These methods try to assign to an instance's __class__ attribute, or
    access the instances __dict__, which are prohibited in REE.  For the
    first two methods, I re-implemented the old behavior when assignment
    to value.__class__ fails.
    
    For the load_build() I also re-implemented the old behavior when
    inst.__dict__.update() fails but this means that unpickling in REE is
    semantically different than unpickling in unrestricted mode.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 22 18:14:39 1998 +0000

    Fixed indexing of {datadesc} environments.
    
    Removed " (byte code instruction)" from the output of the {opcodedesc}
    environment; this should only appear in the index (which it now does).
    
    Removed some really old cruft related to otherwise removed debugging code.
    (I *think* assignments to $* set & clear auto-flush of <STDOUT>, but don't
    really remember.  Removing them seems to not change anything!)

    \seemodule{}:  Use logical markup for the module name, to ensure it picks up
            any changes introduced there.  Also ensure a little more space between
            the module name and the parenthesized comment.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Jan 22 17:37:50 1998 +0000

    Added descriptions for log() and log10().
    
    Clarified that floor() and ceil() return reals.  Same for the integer part
    returned by modf().
    
    Some markup consistency changes.

    Revised new macros after discussion with Guido:  Always use full names of
    semantic concepts.
    
    Added two new ones (not discussed with Guido:
    
    \constant{}:  Markup for constants defined in Python modules.
    
    \cfunction{}:  Markup for C functions; these should probably be distinguished
            by font, but are not at this time (since they're typically \code{} at
            this point).

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 21 05:14:24 1998 +0000

    (py-mode-map): Add a binding of C-m to py-newline-and-indent.  This is
    a religious issue: RMS decrees that the Enter (RET) key should just do
    a newline and a LFD (C-j) should do a newline and indent (i.e. the
    python-mode version of this).  Almost everyone I know disagrees and
    finds that RET should do newline and indent.  Almost everyone hacks
    their modes to do this, if they know how.  Because it's hard for
    newbies to figure out how to do this, and because most DOS keyboards
    lack a LFD (leaving users to the more obscure C-j), I think it makes
    better sense to add this default binding.

    Simple documentation of the copy_reg module.
    
    Guido, you should probably look at this.  The pickle documentation is out of
    date; I don't see anything about the __reduce__() stuff or the
    __safe_for_unpickling__ attribute.

    (py-compute-indentation): In the most common case, where indentation
    is based on the line above, watch out for landing inside a triple
    quoted string.  In this case, use iterative search +
    parse-partial-sexp backwards to find the beginning of the string.
    
    Note this does affect performance, but very little in the common cases
    (I hope).  It could be made *much* faster by adding Emacs and XEmacs
    dependent code -- different code naturally.  :-(
    
    Fixes the following reported bug:

    (py-master-file): New buffer-local variable which can be set in the
    file local variable section of a file.  When set, and the user hits
    C-c C-c, this file gets executed instead of the buffer's file.  Idea
    given by Roy Dragseth <royd@math.uit.no>, but implemented differently.
    
    (py-execute-buffer): Support py-master-file variable.  If this names a
    relative path, default-directory is prepended via expand-file-name.

    Proposed new macros:  see comments.  These are not yet used.
    
            These are intended to support semantic markup.  There are a number
            of places in the documentation where the exact meaning of an
            indentifier marked \code{} in the running text is ambiguous (could
            be a module or a class, a function or a method, etc.).  These are
            intended to clarify the intent of the identifier for processing
            applications and more intelligent style processing.

    Rewritten PyImport_Cleanup() and its helper, clear_carefully().  They
    now implement the following finalization strategy.
    
    1. Whenever this code deletes a module, its directory is cleared
       carefully, as follows:
       - set all names to None that begin with exactly one underscore
       - set all names to None that don't begin with two underscores
       - clear the directory
    
    2. Modules are deleted in the following order:
       - modules with a reference count of 1, except __builtin__ or __sys__
       - repeat until no more are found with a reference count of 1
       - __main__ if it's still there
       - all remaining modules except __builtin__ or sys
       - sys
       _ __builtin__

    \funcitem{}, \dataitem{}, \excitem{}:  Removed obsolete macros; there are no
            longer used anywhere.  Use the {*desc} environments instead.
    
    \var{}:  Ensure that the argument is always set in roman italic, in case an
             alternate font is being used for code.  These keeps the result of
             \var{} consistent.
    
    Some minor changes to allow easier exploration of alternate fonts for code in
    the running text.  Haven't changed the selected font; I haven't found one that
    has everything required!  (The best non-monospaced font so far was missing
    the <, >, and | characters, or at least had them at the wrong locations.  It
    also allowed confusion between upper-case I and lower-case L.)

    Deleted targets used only by Jim Fulton's now deleted "gMakefile".
    
    Also change the build rules to use $(LIBRARY) instead of

    Added command at end to use times fonts; commented out.  Instructions to use
    times are there as well.
    
    Doing it here means the switch only affects one file and gets everything
    rebuilt as needed.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 13 17:18:57 1998 +0000

    Removed tarps2, tardvi targets based on comments from Guido.
    
    Added -9 option to gzip.  This doesn't save much space, but it's "free" and
    appreaciated by those with slow modems.  (With these tarballs, that means
    "those with modems"...!)
    
    Remove the two tarballs in the clean target.

    Added targets:
    
      tarps - one-sided PostScript
      tarps2 - two-sided PostScript, with ref.ps added as-is.
      tardvi - yes, some people want the .dvi files
    
      all-ps2 - Create the .ps files, but make sure the LaTeX openright option
                is used in the \documentclass.

    Override several functions from the stock latex2html to support the module
    index.  It works, it's ugly, and would probably have to be completely redone
    if we changed latex2html versions.  See the comments.  ;-(
    
    On the other hand, it works.  ;-)
    
    (Wait for myformat.perl checkin as well.)

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 12 23:15:29 1998 +0000

    Added support for \funcline{} and \dataline{}.
    
    For all generated cases of <strong>...</strong> (from this module), change to
    <b>...</b>.  This, from me?  This is entirely to reduce the size of the
    generated markup, which is more of an issue than semantics here.  Since
    <strong> isn't very meaningful anyway, this should be good.

    Lots of minor markup nits, all consistency related.
    
    Consistently use trailing "()" on function / method names.
    
    Wrapped some long lines.

    Document maxsplit arg for split(), with incompatibility note about 1.5
    release bug.
    
    Document groups() changed behaviour (now always returns tuple).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 12 18:57:53 1998 +0000

    Fix two bugs:
    
    (1) maxsplit was ignored in split().
    
    (2) groups() would return a string instead of a singleton tuple when
    there was only one group.

    Modify command descriptions to use \optional{} instead of ad-hoc markup.
    There are still weirdnesses, but less of them.

    \optional{}:  Removed leading word space, allowing more flexibility.
    
    {seealso} environment:  Always start a new paragraph after the "See Also:"
            line; this ensures that formatting is consistent for each subsequent
            \see*{} item.

    Add module reference for cPickle to index.
    
    Consistency:  Always use trailing "()" for function and method names in text.
    
    Consistency:  Always mark parameter names with \var{} in text.
    
    Change questionable text about CORBA to definate text about XDR; "CORBA" isn't
    enough to specify an external representation, and I'm not sure the comment is
    right if we say "IIOP".  I know its right about XDR if we only mention shared
    object references and not recursive structures.

    Consistency:  Always use lower-case markup; one tag was still given in
            uppercase.  (Makes it easier to see what markup is generated by the
            Python manual support and what is generated by standard latex2html.)

    \mytableofcontents      New macro.  Wrapper around \tableofcontents that

    Normalize some markup.

    Updated embed demo, and put a note in the html file that you need a
    source or development distribution to try it.

Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Tue Jan 6 16:48:49 1998 +0000

    I give in. Now Tk is also using resources just above 128, so Python
    now uses only 228-256, leaving 128-228 free for others. This mod
    affects prefs files, libraries and almost everything else, so I've
    upped my local Python to 1.5b4 to remain sane.

    In description of \D, revise markup so that the caret shows up in the HTML
    version as well as the dvi form.  Without the fix, it showed up as an extra
    zero character.
    
    Bug reported by Hugh Sasse <hgs@dmu.ac.uk>.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sun Jan 4 02:03:12 1998 +0000

    Dangerous feature added: when removing local files (i.e., only when -r
    is used), do a recursive delete.  Use -r with even more caution!
    Also changed usage message into a doc string, added a comment or two,
    and rearranged a long line.

commit 85a5c52752813844a20674e9f062b1386fcd3ee1
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 2 03:24:19 1998 +0000

    Descriptions for PyRun_String(), PyRun_File(), and PyRun_CompileString() all
    gave the return type as part of the function field and used an empty return
    type field.  Fixed.
    
    Function name field for PyLong_FromString() included an asterisk at the
    beginning of the function name field; removed.

    Script to convert module index data to module index.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 2 02:57:41 1998 +0000

    Added support for storing information to build a module index.
    
    Enhance the "theindex" environment to add an entry to the table of contents.

commit 875c807c9243aed464e4150f7eac0ea0ffd4bec2
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 2 02:50:13 1998 +0000

    In description of the group() method, fix markup of "\(" and "\)" literals;
    "\code{\\(}" produces "(" in the .dvi file and "<BR> (" in the latex2html
    output (the font was right).  Changed to "\code{{\e}(}" variation, which
    fixes both.  Breaks the .texi file generation again.  Oh well.

    When there's no filename, don't make one up.
    Added _test() that behaves (a bit) like gzip.
    Fix a comment (*sequential* access is okay -- *random* access it out!)

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 30 05:44:10 1997 +0000

    Oops, big glitch.  Charles had put a 1 in the column for argument list
    type for all functions.  However many function call PyArg_Parse() and
    need a 0.  This is so that when they didn't change anything, the can
    do Py_INCREF(args); return args.  Reverted this back.  For atof(),
    there's no reason not to use PyArg_ParseTuple(), so I changed the code
    (atoi and atol already used that).

Date:   Tue Dec 30 04:43:36 1997 +0000

    Add a note that up to 1.4, translate() produced Emacs style syntax; in
    1.5, it produces Perl style syntax.  Also change "Python's regular
    expressions" into plain "regular expression" in the intro.

    Updated release date to match boilerplate.tex.
    
    Removed implied future availability of an info/texi version of the other
    manuals (the word "yet").
    
    Guido, you might want to check this file to see if any other changes are
    required.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 30 04:40:25 1997 +0000

    Took out some disclaiming text (even from the title!).  Rewritten
    abstract.  Alas, I didn't get to do anything else before the release
    :-(

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

Date:   Tue Dec 30 04:07:19 1997 +0000

    Two critical fixes to the changes that I made for Greg McFarlane --
    patches provided by Greg (am I glad I sent him my latest version!).

commit 13704a89288e4a742f100d3005c482162a13bf59
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 22:04:44 1997 +0000

    Added .PHONY annotation for lib.info target; the real target is
    python-lib.info.  The annotation is needed to prevent at least GNU make from
    building a second set of info files with the lib.info base name.

    Remove more commented-out text that is no longer needed.

commit 29d3b9368c9ee33630314549385cf422b19fab98
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 21:42:03 1997 +0000

    Remove the commented-out warning at the top.  It shouldn't be there
    for the 1.5 release version of the file.

commit 43c9350f7a61e71b6c7d709358b2b45380302fe0
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 21:40:35 1997 +0000

    Getting uglier.  But it doesn't completely bomb except for some table stuff.
    I'll get to it when I can.

commit 78f8e98232a551f2b53fdd5e60188a14292b906c
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 21:39:39 1997 +0000

    Lots of minor nits that allow this file to get processed without failures by
    the info generation phases.  Most of the errors had occurred in the makeinfo
    step.
    
    Commented out the warning at the top; this should still really be removed
    before 1.5, but that's not my call.  It generated problems for the info
    conversion as well.

commit 6810a29c649001fc3c6033f471bc0f63b73f7775
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 21:37:21 1997 +0000

    Reduce warning count from partparse.py.
    
    Removed BaseHTTPServer.py from list of undocumented modules.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 21:31:23 1997 +0000

    Revised lib1.texi target to deal with some conversion nastiness.  See comment.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 20:28:33 1997 +0000

    Reduce warning count from partparse.py.

commit 5baf4bc97863dc2a5e89ca22ac73bdbf34dff925
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 20:05:45 1997 +0000

    Moved things around a bit in interact(), so outout is processed before
    input.  When an EOF is read, break out of the loop instead of (by
    default) writing an empty line (which doesn't do much good).  Don't
    close self when falling through the loop.

commit 588f38ec2acf8b912bac65167f9e4507e9907767
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>

commit 9fd41e363b4780ae9af475f9c23c0a3cf69d70ad
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Dec 29 19:59:33 1997 +0000

    Fixed several bugs reported by Greg McFarmane:
    
     *  The invoke methods of the three Tkinter widgets Button,
        Checkbutton and Radiobutton should return the value returned by
        the callback, (like the Menu widget does):
    
            def invoke(self):
                return self.tk.call(self._w, 'invoke')
    
     *  The select_from method of the Canvas widget should use 'from', not
        'set':
    
            def select_from(self, tagOrId, index):
                self.tk.call(self._w, 'select', 'from', tagOrId, index)
    
        Currently, if you use select_from, you get the error message:
     'TclError: bad select option "set": must be adjust, clear, from, item, or to'
    
     *  The 'entrycget' and 'type' methods of the Tk menu widget are
        missing from Tkinter.
    
     *  There is a bug in grid_columnconfigure and grid_rowconfigure.  For
        example, this should return the current value of the 'minsize'
        option for column 0:
    
            f.grid_columnconfigure(0, 'minsize')
    
        Instead it returns the same as:
    
            f.grid_columnconfigure(0)
    
        I suggest that the hint given in the comment in the
        Tkinter.Misc.configure method should be followed - "ought to
        generalize this so tag_config etc.  can use it".  Repeating the
        same configure code several times in Tkinter is inviting errors.
        [I did not follow this advice --G]
    
     *  The grid_slaves method should handle options.  Currently, to pass
        options to the grid_slaves method, you have to do something like:
    
            grid_slaves('-row', 1)

    and ask the user for permission to set buffer-local variables depending on
    the user's configuration.  Not really needed since this doesn't get edited

    Solve two annoying problems with ftp URLs for Jack: when repeated
    retrieving files from the same host and directory, you had to close
    the previous instance before opening a new one; and retrieving a
    non-existent file would return an empty file.  (The latter fix relies
    on maybe an undocumented property of NLST -- NLST of a file returns
    just that file, while NLST of a non-existent file returns nothing.  A
    side effect, unfortunately, seems to be that now ftp-retrieving an
    *empty* directory may fail.  Ah well.)

    Patch by Brian Gallew for DG/UX.  I'm not quite sure what it does but
    it seems harmless for other platforms.  It plays tricks with the name
    of the library used to link with.  Apparently DG/UX really wants a
    shared library to link with if it wants shared modules to use symbols
    from the library.  I'm not sure why this wasn't an issue with 1.4;
    DG/UX seems to be the only platform where moving to a single library
    made things harder!
    
    BTW This adds a target to create libpython$(VERSION).so; however this
    target is *only* for DG/UX.

commit 819b789f3632e6cc727147b2ec89a3d9a0590d91
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 17 03:08:27 1997 +0000

    gen_index_id():  New function.  Construct an index key such that the sort
            is stable and the form is only defined in one place, since we do
            some fancy footwork with the keys to separate the defining instance
            of a module reference from other references in the HTML index.
    
    make_index_entry():  Override the standard definition to use get_index_id().
    
    make_str_index_entry():  Moved to myformat.perl; only needed there.
    
    index_key_eq():  Override the standard definition.  Add key transforms to
            remove extra junk from the end of the keys; it was only there to
            maintain ordering.
    
    clean_key():  Remove key transform no longer needed at this stage, because
            keeping it makes the sort unstable.
    
    add_idx():  Add key transforms to undo the mess we do to separate a module's
            defining and reference entries.  Don't make the text bold.

    make_str_index_entry():  Moved from .latex2html-init; it's really specific
            to the presentation.

    Changed \indexsubitem from ({\tt HTMLParser} method) to just
    (HTMLParser method).

    Jim Fulton writes:
    
    The attached patch adds the following behavior to the handling
    of REDUCE codes:
    
    - A user-defined type may have a __reduce__ method that returns
      a string rather than a tuple, in which case the object is
      saved as a global object with a name given by the string returned
      by reduce.
    
      This was a feature added to cPickle a long time ago.
    
    
    - User-defined types can now support unpickling without
      executing a constructor.
    
      The second value returned from '__reduce__' can now be None,
      rather than an argument tuple.  On unpickling, if the
      second value returned from '__reduce__' during pickling was
      None, then rather than calling the first value returned from
      '__reduce__', directly, the '__basicnew__' method of the
      first value returned from '__reduce__' is called without
      arguments.
    
    I also got rid of a few of Chris' extra ()s, which he used
    to make python ifs look like C ifs.

commit d0753e20b256057a6320e95e43974f053f4123f1
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 10 22:59:55 1997 +0000

    At Barry's suggestion, plug the security leak by using an empty
    __builtins__ for all calls to eval().  This still allows someone to
    write string.atof("[1]*1000000") (which Jim Fulton worries about) but
    effectively disables access to system modules and functions.

commit 90d62ab0a175b8f3451ee74f29d5de83650e2292
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 10 22:35:02 1997 +0000

    Since this module is used as a fallback in case no built-in modules
    have been configured, string.atof() should not fail when "import re"
    fails (usually because pcre is not there).
    
    This opens up a tiny security hole: *if* an attacker can make "import
    re" fail, they can also make string.atof(arbitrary_string) evaluate
    the arbitrary string.  Nothing to keep me awake at night...

commit e680546894ae6e5dffe8b6f6a6a17a56301033ae
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 10 19:36:41 1997 +0000

    Don't specify base 0 to string.atoi when unpickling integers in text
    mode.  The pickler always uses base 10 so the default base should be
    fine.  (The base gets us in trouble when there's no strop module, as
    the atoi() in string.py only supports base 10.  This is for JPython.)

    Modified quicksort by Raymund Galvin, after studying the GNU libg++
    quicksort.  This should be much faster if there are lots of
    duplicates, and otherwise at least as good.

    Adding a new project: pythonw, or WinMain.c, containing a main program
    that doesn't have a console window attached.  stdout/stderr are lost.
    This is handy though for things like grail.

            Guido:  I hope this is ok; it seems to make a lot of sense to get the

    Jim Fulton:
    
            - Loading non-binary string pickles checks for insecure
              strings. This is needed because cPickle (still)
              uses a restricted eval to parse non-binary string pickles.
              This change is needed to prevent untrusted
              pickles like::
    
                "S'hello world'*2000000\012p0\012."
    
              from hosing an application.
    
            - User-defined types can now support unpickling without
              executing a constructor.
    
              The second value returned from __reduce__ can now be None,
              rather than an argument tuple. On unpickling, if the second
              value returned from __reduce__ during pickling was None, then
              rather than calling the first value returned from __reduce__,
              directly, the __basicnew__ method of the first value returned
              from __reduce__ is called without arguments.

    Some reorganization (all limit operations & constants together, and all usage
    functions and constants together).
    
    Make explicit datadesc sections for each of the constants which might appear,
    and have a description of each.  (Descriptions are based on the Linux
    documentation and sources and the Solaris man pages.)
    
    Hopefully Jeremy won't mind, because I didn't ask.  ;-)

    Two changes by Jeff Rush (slightly tweaked):
    
    - New option -x, to skip first line of script
    
    - Use the correct platform-specific delimiter and library location in
    the usage message
    
    (Also removed two blank lines and moved one line around so that each
    part of the usage message is again under 512 bytes and the whole usage
    message still fits in 23 lines.)

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Dec 5 19:42:42 1997 +0000

    When instantiating a class with no arguments and where the class does
    not define __getinitargs__, bypass the __init__ constructor
    completely.  This uses the trick of instantiating an empty dummy class
    and then changing inst.__class__ to the real class.  This is done in
    two places: once for the INST and once for the OBJ format code.
    
    Also replaced the much outdated long doc string with a short summary
    of the module; the information of that doc string is already
    incorporated in the library reference manual.

    Prefer \code{blat} and \emph{blat} to {\tt blat} and {\em blat}; this matches
    current style in the Library Reference a bit better.
    
    Made the example startup banner current.  The version number should be
    bumped before the next release.

    Remove spurious underscore following book title.  Added specific reference to
    a Win32 networking book.
    
    Changed \indexsubitem from (in module SocketServer) to (SocketServer protocol),

    Arg; more nits, but I may as well finish the job.

    Remove some trailing whitespace from VM instruction pseudo-code.

    When --with-thread(s) is specified, the thread module is now automatically
    enabled.  This is done through a substitution in Modules/Setup.thread(.in).
    Bill Janssen will be happy.  The original idea was by Lele Gaifax (though
    I changed the implementation to use a separate file).

    Moved the thread module to its own Setup.thread(.in) file,
    which is edited by the config.status script depending on whether
    --with-thread is specified or not.  Also needs changes to configure(.in).

    make_str_index_entry():  New function.  Similar to make_index_entry(), but
            includes the string in the returned value instead of the dummy
            filler character.
    
    add_idx():  Override the latex2html function of the same name; this gets
            the anchor properly embedded in the <dt> element, so the index
            works in Grail too.

    Removed redundant eval-when-compile.
    
    (python-mode): Conditionalize imenu initializations to when we can
    safely require imenu.  Under Emacs this should prevent python-mode
    from hosing the global value of imenu-create-index-function and
    messing things up for all other modes.  Problem identified by
    Christian Egli.

    The biggie:  changed the funcdesc environments used for opcode descriptions
    to use the opcodedesc environment.
    
    Changed a \code{} to a \file{} near the start where a file is referenced.
    
    Fixed a typo:  "on" --> "one" in ROT_THREE description.
    
    Wherever opcodes were referenced by name, use \code{OPCODE_NAME}; usage was
    inconsistent.  Ideally, another macro would be defined since these don't
    represent code a programmer would type, but that's minor even for me.  It'll
    probably get converted automatically in the SGML conversion project.  Whether
    that matters or not isn't relevant at this point.

    Added environment for defining PyVM instructions.  This is only used in
    the libdis.tex file I'm about to check in.
    
    I'm not sure this is really an optimal solution yet, but it may be the best
    alternative.  It avoids describing the instructions as either data items or
    functions.
    
    This change was discussed with Guido.  (Guido:  Take a look at the LaTeX
    output for this; if this is reasonable I'll go ahead and update the perl
    code in myformat.perl to match.)

    Changes for FreeBSD and NetBSD: NetBSD does shared libs just like FreeBSD
    (big surprise), and FreeBSD has pthread support in -lc_r -- maybe NetBSD
    has too.

    Skip directories when installing library files; this avoids problems
    when test/output is found (/usr/bin/install chokes on this; no idea

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

    Support type objects in isinstance().
    
    E.g. isinstance('',types.StringType) will return true now instead of
    raising a TypeError exception.  This is for JPython compatibility.

    Generated from Solaris 2.6's /usr/include/sys/stropts.h via

    Comment out crypt by default; it's not used very much and messes up
    the default build on Linux (because it requires -lcrypt which isn't
    availabel everywhere).
    
    Some improvements to the _tkinter build line suggested by Case Roole.

    Lemburg.

    In string.split(), honor maxsplit (if > 0).
    
    In string.splitfields(), ignore maxsplit if <= 0, rather than ignoring
    maxsplit=0 but effectively treating negative numbers the same as
    maxsplit=1.  Also made the test for maxsplit slightly more efficient
    (set it to the length of the string when <= 0 so the test for its
    presence can be omitted from the loop).

    _Environ(): Added __getinitargs__() method so os.environ.copy() works,
    as does unpickling, as in: pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(os.environ)).
    
    Hope this is right!  Don't shoot me Guido. :-)

    mymemreplace(), strop_replace(): Add support for optional 4th argument
    maxsplit which is implemented in string.py but wasn't here.  The
    reference manual doesn't define what happens when maxsplit is negative
    or larger than the number of occurrences, but in either case, I
    implemented this as all get replaced.  Default value is zero which
    replaces all occurrences.

    Slip of the keyboard (f__ should be __).  Dunno why I had a totally
    messed up (but not checked in) version in my work files and didn't
    notice before releasing 1.5 -- at least the distributed latex file
    doesn't have the bogus warning about changed __init__ semantics.

    (py-mode-map): Bind py-mark-def-or-class to C-M-h with a different
    spelling so that it doesn't clobber the standard M-BS binding.  This
    should be portable between X/Emacsen.

Date:   Wed Nov 26 06:14:40 1997 +0000

    (python-mode): Make imenu-create-index-function buffer local.
    
    (imenu-example--create-python-index-engine): Use
    buffer-substring-no-properties.  Also, don't use
    imenu-create-submenu-name.  Apparently it is obsolete.
    
    These Imenu patches were given by Christian Egli
    <christian.egli@stest.ch>

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>

    (py-mark-def-or-class): Added an exchange-point-and-mark and a
    py-keep-region-active so that the marked def/class gets the
    zmacs-region or transient-mark region highlighted.  Also point should
    be left at the end of the marked region.
    
    (py-mode-map): Moved py-mark-def-or-class to M-C-h to conform to Emacs
    major mode standards.

Date:   Wed Nov 26 04:48:23 1997 +0000

    Added CRLF line endings since this is for NOTEPAD.

commit a0ee8cd982940e57a2df05de9be0bd16b561cb3b
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 26 01:04:44 1997 +0000

    Added comment about where to find details on python-mode.el, pointing
    to the Web site.
    
    (py-defun-start-re, py-class-start-re): Changed to defconst.
    
    (py-traceback-line-re): Regular expression describing what traceback
    lines look like.
    
    (py-point): New defsubst copied from CC Mode.
    
    (py-highlight-line): Function which does the work of making a
    traceback line mouseable.  This only works on XEmacs.  Someone familar
    with Emacs text properties and such will have to do that port.
    
    (py-mode-map): Added C-c- bound to py-up-exception and C-c= bound to
    py-down-exception.  Also, more concise form for mapcar.
    
    (py-mode-output-map): New keymap for the *Python Output* buffer which
    only has keybindings for py-mouseto-exception and py-goto-exception.
    All other self-insert-command's are bound to beep.  This is actually
    bogus because the buffer should really be made read-only and the
    functions that insert in that buffer should bind inhibit-read-only.
    Also, this map should be bound to highlighted extents in a *Python*
    shell buffer, but this stuff hasn't been migrated into there.
    
    (py-postprocess-output-buffer): New function which extentifies the
    *Python Output* buffer.  The bogosities are that this only runs when
    the synchronous process in the buffer is finished (so it doesn't work
    for async procs), and it should also be merged into py-process-filter
    so the *Python* shell gets mouseable too.
    
    (py-shell): Added C-c- and C-c= to the comint buffer's keymap.  The
    bogosity is that py-goto-exception should also be bound, but it cannot
    be bound to C-cC-c (since that interferes with
    comint-interrupt-subjob's typical binding).  Also, traceback lines
    aren't mouseable in this buffer.
    
    (py-execute-region): Support for traceback jumping.  This really is
    quite a kludge, but necessary based on the way all this stuff works.
    There's bound to be broken interactions here.
    
    (py-jump-to-exception, py-mouseto-exception, py-goto-exception,
    py-find-next-exception, py-down-exception, py-up-exception): All new
    commands and functions to implement traceback jumping.
    
    (py-compute-indentation): Hope this change doesn't get lost in all the
    noise above!!!!  This fixes broken non-indentation of a line when TAB
    is hit inside a string that isn't a multi-line string.

commit ee9f820cf118d2b88a74fe35b3f7e9476ea40b1b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 25 21:12:27 1997 +0000

    Documented brand new behavior of sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 (str() is applied
    to get the actual prompt).

commit ddc3fb573429a40ac7c80088edf25ee19f7a5265
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 25 20:58:13 1997 +0000

    Apply str() to sys.ps1 or sys.ps2 before using them as a prompt, so
    you can assign an object whose str() evaluates to the current

commit 84cca446f2829b114d472d5b41d0003115cd9382
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

    Added the "italic correction" command ("\/") to the list of ignored commands.
    There is at least one of there in the library reference, and this reduces
    the warning count.  We *do* know what to do with it!

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 25 04:04:00 1997 +0000

    Removed leading comment about this being "introductory" documentation;
    compared to most, I'd say this section is fairly thorough.
    
    Fixed \indexsubitem definitions for symbol and token module sub-documents.
    Perhaps these should be moved to their own files, but they're awefully
    small.

    Change the option used on Linux to export all symbols

Date:   Fri Nov 21 17:12:59 1997 +0000

    A new standard module, as discussed on comp.lang.python, to simplify
    the writing of filters.
    
    Typical use is:
    
        import fileinput
        for line in fileinput.input():
            process(line)
    
    This iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:],
    defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty or when a filename is
    '-'.
    
    There is also an option to use this to direct the output back to the
    input files.

    (Queue.Empty): When class based exceptions are in force, derive this
    class from the standard base exception Exception.  Otherwise define
    Queue.Empty as a string exception.
    
    (Queue): 8-space to 4-space indentation conversion.  Also, basically

    User-level locale module.  A wrapper around _locale which adds
    format(), str(), atof(), and atoi().  The last three are locale
    sensitive versions of the corresponding standard functions (only for
    numbers though); format() does general %[efg] formatting taking the
    locale into account, optionally with thousands grouping.

    Fix importing of shared libraries from inside packages.
    This is a bit of a hack: when the shared library is loaded, the module
    name is "package.module", but the module calls Py_InitModule*() with just
    "module" for the name.  The shared library loader squirrels away the true
    name of the module in _Py_PackageContext, and Py_InitModule*() will
    substitute this (if the name actually matches).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 19 16:15:37 1997 +0000

    Two changes (here we go again :-( ).
    
    1) The __builtins__ variable in the __main__ module is set to the
    __builtin__ module instead of its __dict__.
    
    2) Get rid of the SIGHUP and SIGTERM handlers.  They can't be made to
    work reliably when threads may be in use, they are Unix specific, and
    Python programmers can now program this functionality is a safer way
    using the signal module.

    Add declaration for PyNumber_CoerceEx().

commit 242c64256c03f94e043a7528ff5b7e0220262d8d
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 19 16:03:17 1997 +0000

    Add a new function PyNumber_CoerceEx() which works just like
    PyNumber_Coerce() except that when the coercion can't be done and no
    other exceptions happen, it returns 1 instead of raising an
    exception.
    
    Use this function in PyObject_Compare() to avoid raising an exception
    simply because two objects with numeric behavior can't be coerced to a
    common type; instead, proceed with the non-numeric default comparison.
    
    Note that this is a somewhat questionable practice -- comparisons for
    numeric objects shouldn't default to random behavior like this, but it
    is required for backward compatibility.  (Case in point, it broke
    comparison of kjDict objects to integers in Aaron Watters' kjbuckets
    extension.)  A correct fix (for python 2.0) should involve a different
    definiton of comparison altogether.

commit 359bcaa539d9bbb2b008b5fd0a76c758b489bed5
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 14 22:24:28 1997 +0000

    This fix (across 4 files in 3 directories) solves a subtle problem with
    signal handlers in a fork()ed child process when Python is compiled with
    thread support.  The bug was reported by Scott <scott@chronis.icgroup.com>.
    
    What happens is that after a fork(), the variables used by the signal
    module to determine whether this is the main thread or not are bogus,
    and it decides that no thread is the main thread, so no signals will
    be delivered.
    
    The solution is the addition of PyOS_AfterFork(), which fixes the signal
    module's variables.  A dummy version of the function is present in the
    intrcheck.c source file which is linked when the signal module is not
    used.

    Suggestion by David Ascher: set EXE macro to empty string and use it
    in a few places -- so it can be set to .exe on GNUWIN32 platforms and
    do the right thing.  Whatever.  (This was already done in
    Modules/Makefile* but wasn't carried over here.)

commit 368e06b6f06cf843f1c375f93cbda7e241719f2c
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 7 20:38:49 1997 +0000

    Some restructuring.
    
    All geometry manager methods that apply to a master widget instead of
    to a slave widget have been moved to the Misc class, which is
    inherited by all of Tk(), Toplevel() and Widget().  They have been
    renamed to have their geometry manager name as a prefix,
    e.g. pack_propagate(); the short names can still be used where
    ambiguities are resolved so that pack has priority over place has
    priority over grid (since this was the old rule).
    
    Also, the method definitions in the Pack, Place and Grid classes now
    all have their respective geometry manager name as a prefix
    (e.g. pack_configure); the shorter names are aliases defined through
    assignment.
    
    A similar renaming has been done for all config() methods found
    elsewhere; these have been renamed to configure() with config being
    the alias (instead of the other way around).  (This may not make much
    of a difference but the official Tk command name is now 'configure'
    and it may help in debugging tracebacks.)
    
    Finally, a new base class BaseWidget has been introduced, which
    implements the methods common between Widget and Toplevel (the
    difference between those two classes is that Toplevel has a different
    __init__() but also that Toplevel doesn't inherit from Pack, Place or
    Grid.

    Fix problem discovered by Barry: if you hit ^C to
    sys.stdin.readline(), you get a fatal error (no current thread).  This
    is because there was a call to PyErr_CheckSignals() while there was no
    current thread.  I wonder how many more of these we find...  I bnetter
    go hunting for PyErr_CheckSignals() now...

    on NTEmacs 19.34.6.
    
    (py-serial-number): New variable.
    
    (py-execute-region): If make-temp-name is broken, simply append a
    serial number to the string "python-" to get a temporary file name.
    It's possible concurrent NTEmacs can step on each others toes, but it
    makes no sense to further coddle a busted NTEmacs.

    (mark-python-def-or-class): Renamed to py-mark-def-or-class globally.
    
    (py-mode-map): Moved py-mark-def-or-class from M-C-h to C-c C-m since
    the old binding conflicts with the standard global backward-kill-word
    binding, and this new binding is more conformant with other language
    modes.  Moved py-mark-block to C-c C-k.

    Undo half of the previous change :-(
    
    Setting interp->builtins to the __builtin__ module instead of to its
    dictionary had the unfortunate side effect of always running in
    restricted execution mode :-(
    
    I will check in a different way of setting __main__.__builtins__ to
    the __builtin__ module later.
    
    Also, there was a typo -- a comment was unfinished, and as a result
    some finalizations were not being executed.
    
    In Bart Simpson style,

    (py-backspace-function): New variable.
    
    (py-electric-backspace, py-electric-delete): Support the XEmacs 20 Way
    for backspace and delete mappings.  In XEmacs 19, Emacs 19, and Emacs
    20, both backspace and delete keysyms are bound to
    py-electric-backspace.  In XEmacs 20, backspace and delete keysyms are
    bound separately, allowing the user to specify forward or backward
    deletion of the delete keysym through the variable
    delete-key-deletes-forward.  All this is the Right Way To Do It and
    this implementation was largely ripped from CC Mode.

    First round of changes, mostly subprocess stuff.
    
    (py-execute-file): Better interaction with comint.  Set
    comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output to t.  Wrapper buffer change in
    unwind-protect in case process filter fails.
    
    (py-shell): Start Python with -i flag to fix tty problem on Windows;
    presumably -- not yet tested.
    
    (py-clear-queue): New function to clear the pending exec file queue.
    Not currently keybound.
    
    (py-execute-region, py-execute-buffer): Added optional async flag (use
    via C-u prefix) to execute the region in a new asynchrous buffer, even
    if the Python shell is running.
    
    (py-append-to-process-buffer): Removed as obsolete.  Comint provides
    this functionality.
    
    Removed fbound test defun of match-string.  All modern X/Emacsen have
    this function.

    When checking for equality, open the slave file in text mode so it
    will compare equal even if the master file uses only \n to terminate
    lines (this is by far the most common situation).  Also, check for the
    case where the master file is missing, and print the time difference
    in seconds when the slave file appears newer than the master (for
    debugging).

    Use ``0'' instead of ``None'' to reset the underlying object in close
    methods.  Using None causes problems if the destructor is called after
    the __builtin__ module has already been destroyed (unfortunately, this
    can happen!).  I can't just delete the object because it is actually
    tested for (if self._sock: ...).  Setting it to 0 is a bit weird but
    works.

    Move the Py_{{BEGIN,END}_ALLOW,BLOCK}_THREADS macros in time_sleep()
    to inside floatsleep().  This is necessary because floatsleep() does
    the error handling and it must have grabbed the interpreter lock and
    thread state before it can do so.

    Two independent changes (alas):
    
    - The interp->builtins variable (and hence, __main__.__builtins__) is
    once again initialized to the built-in *module* instead of its
    dictionary.
    
    - The finalization order is once again changed.  Signals are finalized
    relatively early, because (1) it DECREF's the signal handlers, and if
    a signal handler happens to be a bound method, deleting it could cause
    problems when there's no current thread around, and (2) we don't want
    to risk executing signal handlers during finalization.

    Doing the most complicated CVS dance I've ever seen.  Barry has had
    his *own* RCS file for python-mode.el, and I've agreed that it would
    be better if his version was in the Python source tree.  However I
    don't want to totally get rid of the old RCS file (which has
    interesting info such as which version was in which Python release).
    So I've moved the old one to python-mode-old.el behind the scenes,
    and this checkin message indicates that I'm now deleting it.
    If you do an update, you will actually get Barry's *new* version!

commit affc0ca0e88bdc4c578cf3667c246cf3f1ce97f2
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 3 16:59:38 1997 +0000

    Changes in preparation for integrating into the Python CVS tree.
    
    Introductory comment updates.
    
    (python-font-lock-keywords): Added "assert"
    
    (py-block-closing-keywords-re): New variable.
    
    (py-no-outdent-re): Rewrite to use py-block-closing-keywords-re.
    
    (py-shell): py-process-filter should no longer be necessary.  Comint
    should do all the work.  Note that more fixes to the py-shell process
    mechanism need to be done.
    
    (py-execute-region): Check for empty region.  Some questionable
    changes to set-buffer after shell-command-on-region.  Again, this all
    needs to be closely examined for X/Emacs 19/20 compatibility.
    
    (py-goto-beyond-final-line): py-parse-partial-sexp-works-p should no
    longer be necessary.
    
    (py-statement-closes-block-p): Use py-block-closing-keywords-re.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 31 18:38:52 1997 +0000

    New policy for package imports: only a directory containing
    __init__.py (or __init__.pyc/.pyo, whichever applies) is considered a
    package.  All other subdirectories are left alone.  Should make Konrad
    Hinsen happy!

Date:   Fri Oct 31 18:37:24 1997 +0000

    Instead of using _PyImport_Inittab[] directly, use the new "official"
    pointer *PyImport_Inittab which is initialized to _PyImport_Inittab.

    Remove the declaration of "internal" table _PyImport_Inittab[]; add
    new "official" pointer *PyImport_Inittab.

    Add empty __init__.py files to the test packages so the new policy
    will recognize them.

    Take out the setlocale() call.  It affects atof() and will break
    floating point literals.  Need to do this differently...

    Hack suggested by Matthias Klose to pull in all relevant entry points
    in libmath.a so they are available to mathmodule.so (in case it is
    shared).  While this still gets triggered on Solaris 2.x, this appears
    to be harmless there.

    Redone (by Ka-Ping) using the new re module, and adding recognition
    for r"..." raw strings.  (And R"..." string support added by Guido.)

Date:   Mon Oct 27 18:56:19 1997 +0000

    This should hopefully finally clean up the remaining __del__ related
    problems with this module, even if an instance of a derived class is
    kept alive longer than the urllib module itself...

    Bugfix in match() -- the number of registers shouldn't be divided by two!

commit e6eef4b4a3a11b00fe5eae44e1af667de0b138b9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sun Oct 26 17:00:25 1997 +0000

    Use __dict__.update(state) instead of for loop over state.items() and
    call to setattr().  This changes semantics, following the change
    already implemented in pickle.
    
    Also reindented a few lines properly.

    re -> regex conversions by Sjoerd.

commit f81e5b9c780e47c8a312a69a7ff71169276a9720
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 23 22:43:50 1997 +0000

    New module -- converts regex regular expressions to re style.
    There are two ways to use this -- as a filter (e.g. using C-U M-| on a
    regex string literal in an Emacs buffer) or from a Python program
    which imports this as a module.  Read the doc string for more info,
    and also some caveats (some cases aren't handled right).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Oct 23 19:09:21 1997 +0000

    Although it's hard to be sure, I *think* this is a working conversion
    from regex to re style regular expressions.  This should make sgmllib
    and htmllib threadsafe, so I can now create a threaded version of
    webchecker...

Date:   Wed Oct 22 20:44:58 1997 +0000

    Added pgrep() function, which is like grep/egrep/emgrep but uses Perl
    syntax, by virtue of the new re module.

Date:   Mon Oct 20 23:46:54 1997 +0000

    Catch KeyboardInterrupt separately and propagate it, instead of
    reporting a "crash".
    
    Use sys.exc_info() instead of sys.exc_type and sys.exc_value.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 20 23:31:15 1997 +0000

    Add optional 4th argument to count(), matching find() etc.
    Also change all occurrences of "x == None" to "x is None" (not that it
    matters much, these functions are all reimplemented in strop -- but
    count() is not).

    code had the assignments switched around).
    
    Also rename sharedmodules to lib-dynload.

    count() now has a 4th parameter too.  Also rephrased the docs for find
    to use the same, better words to explain start/end.

    Change Python-as-executable-script example to use "#! /usr/bin/env python"
    since that's now the recommended way to do it.
    
    In pickling discussion, change "code{pickle}" (not missing leading "\") to
    "This" since the immediately preceeding sentence ended with the same text
    (with the proper "\").  Fixes a formatting bug and an odd glitch in the
    writing.

    Marangozov.

commit a59406abdfd1393db708b379003fe3ab0dd0af2e
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 10 17:39:19 1997 +0000

    Darn.  When thread support is disabled, the BEGIN/END macros don't
    save and restore the tstate, but explicitly calling
    PyEval_SaveThread() does reset it!  While I think about how to fix
    this for real, here's a fix that avoids getting a fatal error.

    Put back the extern declaration for strdup(), between #ifndef MS_WINDOWS.
    This should make everybody happy, especially since we don't say what
    the argument type is (there is disagreement on that, too :-( ).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 6 18:54:01 1997 +0000

    Several changes:
    
    - Change the code that looks for robots.txt to always look in /, even
    if the "root" path is somewhere deep down below.
    
    - Add link processing in <AREA> tags.
    
    - Change safeclose() to avoid crashing when the file has no geturl()
    method.

    method.

commit c38c5da5d0ce35442e859d64e6cfa734688a470e
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 6 17:49:20 1997 +0000

    dict_get(): New method for item access with different semantics than
    __getitem__().  This method never raises an exception; if the key is
    not in the dictionary, the second (optional) argument is returned.  If
    the second argument is not provided and the key is missing, None is
    returned.
    
    mapp_methods: added "get" method.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 6 15:48:20 1997 +0000

    Move the __getitem__() definition from StandardException to Exception.
    This allows stuff like this out of the box:
    
            try:
                ...
            except socket.error, (code, msg):
                ...

    New "re" regular expression support.
    The new re module was written by Andrew Kuchling and uses the pcre
    code in ../Modules/.  The old re module has been renamed to re1,
    just in case you need it for comparison.

    New "re" regular expression support.
    This code is written by Philip Hazel and Andrew Kuchling.
    It requires a new "re.py" module, too.

    Turns out whatsound.py and sndhdr.py were identical modules.
    Since there's also an imghdr.py file, I propose to make sndhdr.py the
    official one.  For compatibility, whatsound.py imports * from
    sndhdr.py.

    Fix small omission: with all the new code, sys.exit(None) would print
    "None"; this should be equivalent to sys.exit(0).

    There was actually a test that ensured that raising an exception A
    with an instance of a derived class B would really raise an A, not a
    B.  Since Barry fixed this anomalous behaviour, I though I might as
    well fix the test!  (Hmm, Barry, did you not run the tests or did you
    miss that test_opcodes failed?)

Date:   Wed Oct 1 04:29:29 1997 +0000

    Apply two changes, systematically:
    
    (1) Use PyErr_NewException("module.class", NULL, NULL) to create the
        exception object.
    
    (2) Remove all calls to Py_FatalError(); instead, return or
        ignore the errors -- the import code now checks PyErr_Occurred()
        after calling a module's init function, so it's no longer a
        fatal error for the initialization to fail.
    
    Also did some small cleanups, e.g. removed unnecessary test for
    "already initialized" from initfpectl(), and unified
    initposix()/initnt().
    
    I haven't checked this very thoroughly, so while the changes are
    pretty trivial -- beware of untested code!

    Add optional bufsize argument to various calls so we can make the
    os.fdopen() calls unbuffered.  I presume that it's enough if we can
    make all three of them (for stdin, stdout, and stderr) unbuffered and
    don't need to specify different buffer sizes per file -- that would
    complicate the interface more than I care for.

    Add an optional hack for threads in Tkinter.
    This one works!  However it requires using a modified version of
    tclNotify.c (provided), which requires access to the Tcl source
    to compile it.  In order to enable this hack, add the following
    to the Setup line for _tkinter:
       tclNotify.c -DHAVE_PYTCL_WAITUNTILEVENT -I$(TCL)/generic
    where TCL points to the source tree of Tcl 8.0.  Other versions
    of Tcl are not supported.
    
    The tclNotify.c file is copyrighted by Sun Microsystems; the
    licensing terms are in the file license.terms.  According to this
    file, no further permission to distribute this is required,
    provided the file license.terms is included.  Hence, I am checking
    that in, too.

    Changes submitted by Marc-Andre Lemburg to add two tables: errorcode

    them to message strings.  (The latter is redundant because

    Use Marc Lemburg's tb_lineno() to calculate the correct line number.
    Apparently the traceback object doesn't contains the right linenumber
    when -O is used.  Rather than guessing whether -O is on or off, use
    tb_lineno() unconditionally.

    Word completion for the new readline.set_completer() function.
    
    When completing a simple identifier, it completes keywords, built-ins
    and globals in __main__; when completing NAME.NAME..., it evaluates
    (!) the expression up to the last dot and completes its attributes.
    
    It's very cool to do "import string" type "string.", hit the
    completion key (twice), and see the list of names defined by the
    string module!
    
    Tip: to use the tab key as the completion key, call
    
        readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")

Date:   Fri Sep 26 21:51:21 1997 +0000

    Reordered and reformatted, and added some cool new features:
    
    set_completer(function)
    parse_and_bind(string)
    read_init_file(filename)
    
    The first is the most exciting feature: with an appropriate Python
    completer function, it can do dynamic completion based on the contents
    of your namespace!

    Py_Initialize(): move the call to _PyImport_FixupExtension() to after
    the phase 2 init of the __builtin__ module, so that multiple
    interpreters will get the right exceptions.

    initerrors(): Eliminate circular reference which was causing a small
    but annoying memory leak.  This was introduced when PyExc_Exception
    was added; the loop above populating the PyExc_StandardError exception
    tuple started at index 1 in bltin_exc, but PyExc_Exception was added
    at index 0, so PyExc_StandardError was getting inserted in itself!
    How else can a tuple include itself?!
    
    Change the loop to start at index 2.
    
    This was a *fun* one! :-)

    Two subtle changes:

    (2) Do less work in __init__(), and more in __str__ (store args

    Three independent changes:
    
    - Don't use "from copy_reg import *".
    
    - Use cls.__module__ instead of calling whichobject(cls, cls.__name__);
      also try __module__ in whichmodule(), just in case.
    
    - After calling save_reduce(), add the object to the memo.

    Update the description and the example to the new functionality, which
    is mostly concentrated in a generalized find_module() and the new
    load_module().  Added the new module type constants.  Declare that
    SEARCH_ERROR and a whole bunch of module-type-specific functions are
    obsolete.

    Crrected a flow control error that caused the wrong error message when

    Major overhaul: this is now little more than a user interface, the
    preference handling code is in modules pythonprefs and preferences.
    This should finally make it easier for someone (Just?) to write a
    decent interface to preference setting, and it'll allow setting
    initial sys.path and such from ConfigurePython.

    Initialize self.__tempfiles to [] in the constructor (else it remains
    a shared class variable -- but each instance will attempt to clean it
    up entirely ob cleanup).

    Change packages -> site-packages

commit d6ead328b36eb686b95dd9949087dc77a6ff0234
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Sep 8 02:08:11 1997 +0000

    *Semantic change*: when unpickling the instance variables of an
    instance, use inst.__dict__.update(value) instead of a for loop with
    setattr() over the value.keys().  This is more consistent (the
    pickling doesn't use getattr() either but pickles inst.__dict__) and
    avoids problems with instances that have a __setattr__ hook.
    
    But it *is* a semantic change (because the setattr hook is no longer
    used).  So beware!

    Initial revision

commit f5f5fdbdd05c187dd56e5f36f3e2e7f27948f944
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Sep 6 20:29:52 1997 +0000

    Significant speedup -- when a submodule imports a global module, add a
    dummy entry to sys.modules, marking the absence of a submodule by the
    same name.
    
    Thus, if module foo.bar executes the statement "import time",
    sys.modules['foo.time'] will be set to None, once the absence of a
    module foo.time is confirmed (by looking for it in foo's path).
    
    The next time when foo.bar (or any other submodule of foo) executes
    "import time", no I/O is necessary to determine that there is no
    module foo.time.
    
    (Justification: It may seem strange to pollute sys.modules.  However,
    since we're doing the lookup anyway it's definitely the fastest
    solution.  This is the same convention that 'ni' uses and I haven't
    heard any complaints.)

    Fix reload() for package submodules.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Sep 6 18:52:03 1997 +0000

    Phase two of package import.  "import a.b.c" and all variants now do the
    right thing.
    
    Still to do:
    
    - Make reload() of a submodule work.
    
    - Performance tweaks -- currently, a submodule that tries to import a
    global module *always* searches the package directory first, even if
    the global module was already imported.  Not sure how to solve this
    one; probably need to record misses per package.
    
    - Documentation!

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Sep 5 19:11:53 1997 +0000

    Fixed some details of printing the str() of an exception.  This fixes
    a core dump when __str__() returns a non-string, and plugs a memory
    leak as well: the result of PyObject_Str() was never DECREFed.

    Made the 'info' argument to SyntaxError optional, so phase-2 syntax
    errors are handled (these gave ``TypeError: not enough arguments'').
    
    Also changed its __str__() to correct a typo (missing self.) and
    return str(self.msg) to ensure the result is always string.
    
    Also changed the default __str__ to simply return str(self.args).

    Fix in trailing comment:  PyDict_SetItemString() does *not* consume a reference
    count, PyList_SetItem() does.  Very confusing!

commit aee0bad0a50f9f533267d241bea97a0b2118f238
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Sep 5 07:33:22 1997 +0000

    First part of package support.
    
    This doesn't yet support "import a.b.c" or "from a.b.c import x", but
    it does recognize directories.  When importing a directory, it
    initializes __path__ to a list containing the directory name, and
    loads the __init__ module if found.
    
    The (internal) find_module() and load_module() functions are
    restructured so that they both also handle built-in and frozen modules
    and Mac resources (and directories of course).  The imp module's
    find_module() and (new) load_module() also have this functionality.
    Moreover, imp unconditionally defines constants for all module types,
    and has two more new functions: find_module_in_package() and
    find_module_in_directory().
    
    There's also a new API function, PyImport_ImportModuleEx(), which
    takes all four __import__ arguments (name, globals, locals, fromlist).
    The last three may be NULL.  This is currently the same as
    PyImport_ImportModule() but in the future it will be able to do
    relative dotted-path imports.
    
    Other changes:
    
    - bltinmodule.c: in __import__, call PyImport_ImportModuleEx().
    
    - ceval.c: always pass the fromlist to __import__, even if it is a C
    function, so PyImport_ImportModuleEx() is useful.
    
    - getmtime.c: the function has a second argument, the FILE*, on which
    it applies fstat().  According to Sjoerd this is much faster.  The
    first (pathname) argument is ignored, but remains for backward
    compatibility (so the Mac version still works without changes).
    
    By cleverly combining the new imp functionality, the full support for
    dotted names in Python (mini.py, not checked in) is now about 7K,
    lavishly commented (vs. 14K for ni plus 11K for ihooks, also lavishly
    commented).
    
    Good night!

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Sep 5 07:11:32 1997 +0000

    Added PyImport_ImportModuleEx(name, globals, locals, fromlist); this
    is like PyImport_ImporModule(name) but receives the globals and locals
    dict and the fromlist arguments as well.  (The name is a char*; the
    others are PyObject*s).

Date:   Fri Sep 5 07:08:39 1997 +0000

    Contribution by Hannu Krosing (with some changes).
    
    Added 'p' format character for Pascal string (i.e. leading length
    byte).  This uses the count prefix line 's' does, except that the
    count includes the length byte; i.e. '10p' takes 10 bytes packed but
    has space for a length byte and 9 data bytes.

Date:   Thu Sep 4 23:39:23 1997 +0000

    Several changes:
    
    1. Fix bug in (de)compression objects.  The final string resize used
    zst.total_out to determine the length of the string, but the
    (de)compression object will output data a little bit at a time, which
    means total_out is not the string size.  Fix: save original value of
    total_out at the start of the call.
    
    2. Be sure to Py_DECREF the result value if you exit with an
    exception.
    
    3. Use PyInt_FromLong instead of Py_BuildValue
    
    4. include more constants from the zlib header file
    
    5. Use PyErr_Format instead of using a local buffer and sprintf.

    (inaccessible), FileType (not always accessible), and TracebackType
    and FrameType (inaccessible).

Date:   Wed Sep 3 22:36:15 1997 +0000

    One patch from Sjoerd and one from Jack.
    
    Sjoerd: add separate administration of temporary files created y
    URLopener.retrieve() so cleanup can properly remove them.  The old
    code removed everything in tempcache which was a bad idea if the user
    had passed a non-temp file into it.  (I added a line to delete the
    tempcache in cleanup() -- it still seems to make sense.)
    
    Jack: in basejoin(), interpret relative paths starting in "../".  This
    is necessary if the server uses symbolic links.

    Fix the bug Jeremy was experiencing: both the close() and the
    dealloc() functions contained code to free/DECREF the buffer
    (there were differences between I and O objects but the logic bug was
    the same).  Fixed this be setting the buffer pointer to NULL and

    once.)

commit 28cad964eced3d4fddc6350da60569a48443d0e2
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Aug 30 20:03:28 1997 +0000

    Document newly revamped site configuration mechanism.
    Damn the criticism in c.l.p!

commit 36764b8b0e2f7fee83196bb08d78efda7092c472
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Aug 30 20:02:25 1997 +0000

    Added docs for 'user' customization module.  Renamed libuser.tex
    (which had UserDict/UserList) to libuserdict.tex.

commit d7ed683a7ead15583899d7f7fbfb9078139c6a80
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Aug 30 15:02:50 1997 +0000

    Inline PyObject_CallObject (Marc-Andre Lemburg).

commit b2afc811c2a0acf1a9429c848143da1879e32540
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:37:44 1997 +0000

    Added os.altsep; this is '/' on DOS/Windows, and None on systems with
    a sane filename syntax.

commit a28dab5ea2649b244a62ada83d017be39d520099
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:36:47 1997 +0000

    Write out the dynamic OS choice, to avoid exec statements.
    Adding support for a new OS is now a bit more work, but I bet that
    'dos' or 'nt' will cover most situations...

commit 7922bd7382c7e22ee9f711f6554718b824ac85a4
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:34:47 1997 +0000

    Added -X option to suppress default import of site.py.  Also split the
    usage message in *three* parts under 510 bytes, for low-end ANSI
    compatibility.

commit 3d90af967d27d705e79718204956b5c9c1100b96
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:34:00 1997 +0000

    Added NoSite flag.

commit dcc0c13f74e3f62b00847f4aec93bb5c65e8cf64
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:32:42 1997 +0000

    Two independent changes (oops):
    
    - Changed semantics for initialized flag (again); forget the ref
    counting, forget the fatal errors -- redundant calls to
    Py_Initialize() or Py_Finalize() calls are simply ignored.
    
    - Automatically import site.py on initialization, unless a flag is set
    not to do this by main().

commit f30bec7bb2d06da0543d435b1edcb983cbd2801b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:30:45 1997 +0000

    New site.py semantics.  Searches in
    <*prefix>/lib/python<version>/packages for *.pth files containing
    directories that are appended to sys.path.

commit 83b6709d8ec3c81e5434e7fbe898cd60cb395d9f
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:20:16 1997 +0000

    Swap the sense of the -X option vis-a-vis Py_UseClassExceptionsFlag so
    that class based exceptions are enabled by default.  -X disables them
    in favor of the old-style string exceptions.

commit 757af0e7bb7c7d56670fbc84f1f5b0182a54e3d5
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:13:51 1997 +0000

    Removed obsolete exception PyExc_AccessError.
    
    Added PyErr_MemoryErrorInst to hold the pre-instantiated instance when
    using class based exceptions.
    
    Simplified the creation of all built-in exceptions, both class based
    and string based.  Actually, for class based exceptions, the string
    ones are still created just in case there's a problem creating the
    class based ones (so you still get *some* exception handling!).  Now
    the init and fini functions run through a list of structure elements,
    creating the strings (and optionally classes) for every entry.
    
    initerrors(): the new base class exceptions StandardError,
    LookupError, and NumberError are initialized when using string
    exceptions, to tuples containing the list of derived string
    exceptions.  This GvR trick enables forward compatibility!  One bit of
    nastiness is that the C code has to know the inheritance tree embodied
    in exceptions.py.
    
    Added the two phase init and fini functions.

commit 035574d755bfc306704e9975dc10e4e05a47b3bb
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:07:17 1997 +0000

    Added Py_UseClassExceptionsFlag, the variable containing the state of
    the -X command line option.
    
    Py_Initialize(): Handle the two phase initialization of the built-in
    module.
    
    Py_Finalize(): Handle the two phase finalization of the built-in
    module.
    
    parse_syntax_error(): New function which parses syntax errors that
    PyErr_Print() will catch.  This correctly parses such errors
    regardless of whether PyExc_SyntaxError is an old-style string
    exception or new-fangled class exception.
    
    PyErr_Print(): Many changes:
    
        1. Normalize the exception.
    
        2. Handle SystemExit exceptions which might be class based.  Digs
           the exit code out of the "code" attribute.  String based
           SystemExit is handled the same as before.
    
        3. Handle SyntaxError exceptions which might be class based.  Digs
           the various information bits out of the instance's attributes
           (see parse_syntax_error() for details).  String based
           SyntaxError still works too.
    
        4. Don't write the `:' after the exception if the exception is
           class based and has an empty string str() value.

commit d5a0ff972dee45bb30cad3aea15eb50ea6b6fc82
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 22:01:11 1997 +0000

    Added extern definition for -X flag variable.

commit 3e613ce79b45be05065804f3f08ec94813dc74f3
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 21:59:26 1997 +0000

    New file, which is imported by the built-in module when python is
    started with the -X option.  This file contains the definitions for
    the built-in exception classes.

commit 6ed41a0a873ba46247197809b396c6532617251e
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 21:58:25 1997 +0000

    Expanded r() function to handle class exceptions.

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 21:57:49 1997 +0000

    Parse new command line option -X which enables exception classes.

commit 0596c2ac2850f9a978d19a2109794a7cafa20524
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 21:57:07 1997 +0000

    Declarations for two phase initialization and finalization functions
    for the built-in module.

commit 392d8272bf668169d009e8001c205b804ddd8bf8
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 21:56:07 1997 +0000

    Added externs for three new exceptions PyExc_StandardError,
    PyExc_NumberError, and PyExc_LookupError.  Also added extern for
    pre-instantiated exception instance PyExc_MemoryErrorInst.
    
    Removed extern of obsolete exception PyExc_AccessError.

commit 2d8adff10a92fb979795e339395711f782fe71f8
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 21:54:35 1997 +0000

    PyErr_NoMemory(): If the pre-instantiated memory exception is non-null
    (PyExc_MemoryErrorInst) raise this instead of PyExc_MemoryError.  This
    only happens when exception classes are enabled (e.g. when Python is
    started with -X).

commit dd82bb9c14eee9a66b2172f11638d9f7dec8d8b8
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 29 21:52:14 1997 +0000

    Added a new variable TESTPYTHON which contains the path (and args) for
    the executable to use during regression testing.

    Cprrect stuoid tyops -- was comparing variabes with themselves because
    of co/cp mixup.

commit eaedc7ce3296becb466fd42fa07319e9c43771a0
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Thu Aug 28 22:36:40 1997 +0000

    eval_code2(), set_exc_info(): Call PyErr_NormalizeException() the
    former rather than the latter, since PyErr_NormalizeException takes
    PyObject** and I didn't want to change the interface for set_exc_info
    (but I did want the changes propagated to eval_code2!).

    New installation instructions show how to maintain multiple FAQs.
    Removed bootstrap script from end of faqwiz.py module.
    Added instructions to bootstrap script, too.
    Version bumped to 0.8.
    Added <html>...</html> feature suggested by Skip Montanaro.
    Added leading text for Roulette, default to 'Hit Reload ...'.
    Fix typo in default SRCDIR.

    Explicitly close the socket and temp file in URLopener.retrieve(), so
    that multiple retrievals using the same connection will work.
    
    This leaves open the more general problem that after
        f = urlopen("ftp://...")
    f must be closed before another retrieval from the same host should be
    attempted.

    PyErr_Print(): Use PyErr_GivenExceptionMatches() instead of pointer
    compares to test for SystemExit and SyntaxError.

    Handle systemclicks ourselves, in stead of passing them to Sioux. This
    fixes (or masks?) a bug with Python becoming unreactive during
    time.sleep() if you have already switched applications before.

    Output for sequence unpacking test

commit e42b18f9d1fca06df34d9fcbd54a2a6045329197
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 25 22:13:04 1997 +0000

    eval_code2(): collapsed the implementations of UNPACK_TUPLE and
    UNPACK_LIST byte codes and added a third code path that allows
    generalized sequence unpacking.  Now both syntaxes:
    
        a, b, c = seq
        [a, b, c] = seq
    
    can be used to unpack any sequence with the exact right number of
    items.
    
    unpack_sequence(): out-lined implementation of generalized sequence
    unpacking.  tuple and list unpacking are still inlined.

    Checkpoint.

commit b2173c3146e945100ba53bfe6343d20ec3c9a333
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 25 21:23:56 1997 +0000

    Allow assignments to instance.__dict__ and instance.__class__.  The
    former lets you give an instance a set of new instance vars.  The
    latter lets you give it a new class.  Both are typechecked and
    disallowed in restricted mode.
    
    For classes, the check for read-only special attributes is tightened
    so that only assignments to __dict__, __bases__, __name__,
    __getattr__, __setattr__, and __delattr__ (these could be made to work
    as well, but I don't know if that's useful -- let's see first whether
    mucking with instances will help).

Date:   Mon Aug 25 18:36:23 1997 +0000

    Rename roundup() to roundupsize(), as there's a macro roundup() in the
    sys/types.h header on many systems that may get pulled in (through
    WANT_SIGFPE_HANDLER which pulls in signal.h).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 25 18:28:03 1997 +0000

    Removed some colons that shouldn't be there (probably leftovers from

Date:   Fri Aug 22 21:26:19 1997 +0000

    cmp_exception gets promoted (essentially) to the C API function
    PyErr_GivenExceptionMatches().
    
    set_exc_info(): make sure to normalize exceptions.
    
    do_raise(): Use PyErr_NormalizeException() if type is a class.
    
    loop_subscript(): Use PyErr_ExceptionMatches() instead of raw pointer
    compare for PyExc_IndexError.

commit c0dc92af7d41ecf1d60f4ab29452d7179c039d8c
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 22 21:22:58 1997 +0000

    Three new C API functions:
    
    - int PyErr_GivenExceptionMatches(obj1, obj2)
    
      Returns 1 if obj1 and obj2 are the same object, or if obj1 is an
      instance of type obj2, or of a class derived from obj2
    
    - int PyErr_ExceptionMatches(obj)
    
      Higher level wrapper around PyErr_GivenExceptionMatches() which uses
      PyErr_Occurred() as obj1.  This will be the more commonly called
      function.
    
    - void PyErr_NormalizeException(typeptr, valptr, tbptr)
    
      Normalizes exceptions, and places the normalized values in the
      arguments.  If type is not a class, this does nothing.  If type is a
      class, then it makes sure that value is an instance of the class by:
    
      1. if instance is of the type, or a class derived from type, it does
         nothing.
    
      2. otherwise it instantiates the class, using the value as an
         argument.  If value is None, it uses an empty arg tuple, and if
         the value is a tuple, it uses just that.

Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 22 21:14:38 1997 +0000

    Two new built-in functions: issubclass() and isinstance().  Both take
    classes as their second arguments.  The former takes a class as the
    first argument and returns true iff first is second, or is a subclass
    of second.
    
    The latter takes any object as the first argument and returns true iff
    first is an instance of the second, or any subclass of second.
    
    Also, change all occurances of pointer compares against
    PyExc_IndexError with PyErr_ExceptionMatches() calls.

            \bar{Besocial} --> \var{besocial}
                 ^--- note case ----^
    
    The fixed version matches the signature.  Changed "\bar{Besocial} gives ..."
    to "The \var{besocial} flag gives ..." to keep from starting the sentence
    with a lowercase token.
    
    (The \bar{} --> \var{} change was required to keep LaTeX happy.)

    PythonCore is now a fat shared library, the plugin modules aren't fat,
    unfortunately, this turned out to be too difficult.
    
    Plugins.prj now builds all plugin modules, and all the
    interdependencies between the projects are correct. One exception:
    plugins don't attempt to build PythonCore (PythonFAT and PythonApplet do).

    Different strategy regarding whether to declare getrusage() and
    getpagesize() -- #ifdef doesn't work, Linux has conflicting decls in
    its headers.  Choice: only declare the return type, not the argument
    prototype, and not on Linux.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Aug 14 22:23:42 1997 +0000

    Moved some non-standard format characters out of the standard list.
    Also moved %c and %Z out of there, even though they are standard,
    because these are locale dependent (and e.g. on Windows and Mac they
    return different strings).  Finally, sorted the tables slightly
    different, to match my standard docs better (%a before %A).

    Use _beginthread() and _endthread() in favor of CreateThread() and
    ExitThread().  As discussed in c.l.p, this takes care of
    initialization and finalization of thread-local storage allocated by
    the C runtime system.  Not sure whether non-MS compilers grok this
    though (but who cares :-).

    Changes for building under windows.

commit 41b9f00e8f314825a23f635308158cc1488b5c86
Author: Jeremy Hylton <jeremy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Aug 13 23:19:55 1997 +0000

    Many changes.
    
    Change default alloc size for uncompressing to 16K.
    
    Remove comment about core dumps when an invalid window sizes is used.
    This bug has been fixed in zlib 1.0.4.
    
    Two new optional arguments to decompress, wbits and bufsize.  wbits
    specifies the window size and bufsize specifies the initial output
    string size.
    
    In decompression code -- decompress and decompressobj methods -- use a
    Python string (and _PyString_Resize) to collect the uncompressed
    stream.  Replaces a separate buffer that was copied into a string.
    
    Fix bug in decompress that caused it to always realloc the buffer when
    it was finished decompressing.
    
    Modernized handling of optional arguments to compressobj.
    
    Updated doc strings.

    Probably the last VC++ 4.2 makefile I'll check in.
    After this I will be using 5.0, which has binary workspace files...

Author: Jeremy Hylton <jeremy@alum.mit.edu>
Date:   Wed Aug 13 21:39:18 1997 +0000

    removed getpath_nt.c in favor of revamped getpathp.c

commit eea1449a3426094d35c70a16f260d030624430ef
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 13 21:30:44 1997 +0000

    Much rewritten.  Added Win32 registry stuff (from getpath_nt.c, which
    is now obsolete), and changed the default path calculations.
    $PYTHONPATH is now added as a prefix (like it's always been on Unix);
    $PYTHONHOME takes precedence over the program pathname; and only one
    landmark is needed.

commit 407a22d2ce326e2bbb7f0bdfc4609457ec9f51df
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 13 19:57:53 1997 +0000

    Made it real.  Changed locking() to work with file descriptors instead
    of Python file objects.  Added open_osfhandle() (Mark had done some
    work for that), get_osfhandle(), setmode(), and the console I/O
    functions kbhit(), getch(), getche(), ungetch(), and putch().

commit 8f1b6519803ffa7aef45beb58bda654533cb1fa8
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 13 19:55:43 1997 +0000

    Some changes to make it work on NT; add the directory where the binary
    lives to the end of the path.
    
    (Still to do: add $PYTHONPATH to the front instead of using it as is;
    add the Win32 registry paths as in getpath_nt.c (which can then
    retire).)

    Changes by AMK:
    
    Removed handling of \e, \cX escapes, following a string-SIG discussion.
    
    Fixed minor typos in re.py
    re.error is now set equal to reop.error.
    Move definition of constants like NORMAL and CHARCLASS into reop, which
      exports them; re.py was changed to import them from reop.
    Added C equivalents of _expand and expand_escape to reop, and changed
      re.py to use them.

    Two changes:
    
    (1) No longer close self.sock; close it on close().  (Guido)
    
    (2) Don't use regular expressions for what can be done simply with

    CW11 projects replaced by CW Pro 1 projects, and all cfm68k/ppc
    projects unified (as much as possible: PythonCore is still separate).

    Modified for CW Pro 1 projects. Convention used: .mu files are old
    project files, which have to be cleaned up before checking in, .prj
    files are CW Pro 1 projects (which are always clean). Prj files are
    still binhexed, even though they only have a data fork (and, hence,
    could be checked in in binary mode).

    Generate class, property and comparison code (finally!). The resulting
    code isn't ideal yet: xxx.Window(1).Paragraph(3).font will only work
    if all the classes and properties are declared in the same suite, but
    at least font(Paragraph(3, Window(1))) always works.

    Added several new symbols.

    Add a cast to the call to _Py_Dealloc in the expanded version of
    Py_DECREF, to reduce the warnings when compiling with reference count
    debugging on.  (There are still warnings for each call to
    _Py_NewReference -- too bad.)

    New rules for deleting modules.  Rather than having an elaborate
    scheme based on object's types, have a simple two-phase scheme based
    on object's *names*:
    
            /* To make the execution order of destructors for global
               objects a bit more predictable, we first zap all objects
               whose name starts with a single underscore, before we clear
               the entire dictionary.  We zap them by replacing them with
               None, rather than deleting them from the dictionary, to
               avoid rehashing the dictionary (to some extent). */

    Added _Fini() routines to free up some memory

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 5 02:15:12 1997 +0000

    Change the Fini function to only remove otherwise unreferenced strings
    from the interned table.  There are references in hard-to-find static
    variables all over the interpreter, and it's not worth trying to get
    rid of all those; but "uninterning" isn't fair either and may cause
    subtle failures later -- so we have to keep them in the interned
    table.
    
    Also get rid of no-longer-needed insert of None in interned dict.

Date:   Tue Aug 5 02:11:41 1997 +0000

    Added separate free list for cfunction (builtin method) objects, for a
    few percent speed up.  Also add PyCFunction_Fini() to discard it.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 5 02:09:46 1997 +0000

    Provide a dummy empty directory as f_builtins instead of failing, when
    no valid directory is passed in.  This prevents __del__ to fail when
    invoked after __builtins__ has already been discarded.
    
    Also add PyFrame_Fini() to discard the cache of frames.

    Added _Py_ResetReferences(), if tracing references.

    Add Py_Malloc and friends and PyMem_Malloc and friends (malloc
    wrappers for third parties).

    See the comments for the .h files mass checkin (e.g. pystate.h) for
    more detail.

    Removed fatal errors from Py_Initmodule4() (and thus from
    Py_Initmodule(), which is a macro wrapper around it).
    
    The return value is now a NULL pointer if the initialization failed.
    This may make old modules fail with a SEGFAULT, since they don't
    expect this kind of failure.  That's OK, since (a) it "never" happens,
    and (b) they would fail with a fatal error otherwise, anyway.
    
    Tons of extension modules should now check the return value of
    Py_Initmodule*() -- that's on my TODO list.

Date:   Sat Aug 2 02:56:48 1997 +0000

    Mass checkin (more to follow for other directories).
    
    Introduce truly separate (sub)interpreter objects.  For now, these
    must be used by separate threads, created from C.  See Demo/pysvr for
    an example of how to use this.  This also rationalizes Python's
    initialization and finalization behavior:
    
    Py_Initialize() -- initialize the whole interpreter
    Py_Finalize() -- finalize the whole interpreter
    
    tstate = Py_NewInterpreter() -- create a new (sub)interpreter
    Py_EndInterpreter(tstate) -- delete a new (sub)interpreter
    
    There are also new interfaces relating to threads and the interpreter
    lock, which can be used to create new threads, and sometimes have to
    be used to manipulate the interpreter lock when creating or deleting
    sub-interpreters.  These are only defined when WITH_THREAD is defined:
    
    PyEval_AcquireLock() -- acquire the interpreter lock
    PyEval_ReleaseLock() -- release the interpreter lock
    
    PyEval_AcquireThread(tstate) -- acquire the lock and make the thread current
    PyEval_ReleaseThread(tstate) -- release the lock and make NULL current
    
    Other administrative changes:
    
    - The header file bltinmodule.h is deleted.
    
    - The init functions for Import, Sys and Builtin are now internal and
      declared in pythonrun.h.
    
    - Py_Setup() and Py_Cleanup() are no longer declared.
    
    - The interpreter state and thread state structures are now linked
      together in a chain (the chain of interpreters is a static variable
      in pythonrun.c).
    
    - Some members of the interpreter and thread structures have new,
      shorter, more consistent, names.
    
    - Added declarations for _PyImport_{Find,Fixup}Extension() to import.h.

    Print ps (process status) for us when starting a new thread.
    
    Even less shuffling of stdout (only at start of new interpreter).
    
    Interact properly with new interpreter initialization conventions
    (must use Py_Initialize/Py_Finalize *and*
    Py_NewInterpreter/Py_EndInterpreter).
    
    Probably more minor changes.

    Functionality enhancement: allow other threads to use Tk commands
    while one thread is blocked in mainloop().  Also, handle signals (not
    just interrupts) as soon as they happen.
    
    Cleanup: remove support for Tcl/Tk versions 7.4/4.0.  (I've confirmed
    that it works for 7.5/4.1 and 7.6/4.2, as well as 8.0b2.)
    
    Coding style change: instead of ``func (args)'', write ``func(args)''
    everywhere.
    
    Minor functionality change: use PyArg_ParseTuple everywhere.  This
    should only affect the errors reported for bad argument lists; in
    particular, deletefilehandler() is much clearer about what's going
    on.
    
    (XXX Still to do: Mac and Win ports to 8.0b2.)

    Tweaks by Lars Wirzenius to parse some more forms of illegal dates:
    the comma after the day name is optional if it is a recognized day
    name; and the date and month may be swapped.  Thus, the following two

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Jul 19 19:25:33 1997 +0000

    This is now the "real" main program -- it calls Py_Main(argc, argv)
    which is in the library and does all the work.

commit 3768fb1097b0c253716b46313510c27c5afb31f9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Jul 19 19:24:41 1997 +0000

    Tracking changes to Py_Main():
    
    - Got rid of inspection of some environment variables.
    
    - Got rid of Py_GetProgramName() and related logic.
    
    - Print the version header *after* successful initialization.

commit ed52aacb33623ac2e3d768ee3fcc205c6bd9046f
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Jul 19 19:20:32 1997 +0000

    This is no longer the real main program; it now defines Py_Main(), so
    it can be placed in the library.
    
    Other, related changes:
    
    - Moved the inspection of some environment variables to
    Py_Initialize().
    
    - Got rid of -s option.
    
    - Moved Py_GetProgramName() and related logic to pythonrun.c; call
    Py_SetProgramName() instead.
    
    - Print the version header *after* successful initialization.

commit ad6dfda9afa3459eb802618c07969f6a1a0a1287
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Jul 19 19:17:22 1997 +0000

    Moved some stuff here from main.c (part of a big restructuring - wait
    for more!).
    
    - The global flags that can be set from environment variables are now
    set in Py_Initialize (except the silly Py_SuppressPrint, which no
    longer exists).  This saves duplicate code in frozenmain.c and main.c.
    
    - Py_GetProgramName() is now here; added Py_SetProgramName().  An
    embedding program should no longer provide Py_GetProgramName(),
    instead it should call Py_SetProgramName() *before* calling
    Py_Initialize().

    Include pystate.h earlier so it can be referenced by ceval.h.

commit 75aa0d6abe706ef4048c1d38c2cde28d8eb924e3
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 18 23:57:50 1997 +0000

    Use the new functions PyEval_AcquireThread() and
    PyEval_ReleaseThread() (in ceval.c) to set/reset the current thread,
    and at the same time acquire/release the interpreter lock.
    
    Much saner.

commit 2fca21f76280300201acf529527e58e2705ff6aa
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 18 23:56:58 1997 +0000

    PyEval_SaveThread() and PyEval_RestoreThread() now return/take a
    PyThreadState pointer instead of a (frame) PyObject pointer.  This
    makes much more sense.  It is backward incompatible, but that's no
    problem, because (a) the heaviest users are the Py_{BEGIN,END}_
    ALLOW_THREADS macros here, which have been fixed too; (b) there are
    very few direct users; (c) those who use it are there will probably
    appreciate the change.
    
    Also, added new functions PyEval_AcquireThread() and
    PyEval_ReleaseThread() which allows the threads created by the thread
    module as well threads created by others (!) to set/reset the current
    thread, and at the same time acquire/release the interpreter lock.
    
    Much saner.

    Checking in new module code.py -- utilities dealing with code objects.
    Currently, contains one function: compile_command(), which helps
    determining whether a source string is complete, incomplete or in

    Huge speedup by inlining some common integer operations:
    int+int, int-int, int <compareop> int, and list[int].
    (Unfortunately, int*int is way too much code to inline.)
    
    Also corrected a NULL that should have been a zero.

commit 74495409861b357d9925937d6576229c74e2550d
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 14 19:08:15 1997 +0000

    After some discussion with Jeremy and Fred, decided to limit the
    default urlparse cache size to 20 instead of 2000.  The main use of
    the cache seems to be to gain some speed in Grail, which is calling
    urljoin with the same base for each anchor.  2000 is a bit too big for
    Jeremy, who doesn't need the cache at all.  20 should keep at least
    95% of the Grail speedup while wasting an insignificant amount of
    memory in Jeremy's application.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jul 11 19:43:46 1997 +0000

    This is pretty pathetic and full of errors,

    Added (minimal) doc for conditional breakpoints.
    
    (Lie about the syntax (and the syntax for "list") because latex2html

    Only add 1 byte to all malloc calls when it is known that malloc(0) or
    realloc(p, 0) returns NULL.  See changes to configure script to be
    checked in later.

commit b65e85cb738e4bc555dd65111b57c56f27259677
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 10 18:00:45 1997 +0000

    Fix problem discovered by Greg McFarlane: when an imported module
    replaces its own entry in sys.module, reference count errors ensue;
    even if there is no reference count problem, it would be preferable
    for the import to yield the new thing in sys.modules anyway (if only
    because that's what later imports will yield).  This opens the road to
    an official hack to implement a __getattr__ like feature for modules:
    stick an instance in sys.modules[__name__].

commit d247812521c2f020093d98807da3bcc39e233581

Date:   Thu Jul 10 15:14:50 1997 +0000

    Two improvements suggested by Tim Peters: speed up random() since we
    know Python integers are at least 32 bits long; and avoid zeros in
    initial seed value.

    Fix bug reported by Just: anonymous arguments used for tuples should

    fast2locals, I dunno) when the debugger is invoked before they have

Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Fri Jun 20 16:18:15 1997 +0000

    Added PyMac_SetEventHandler which allows you to replace complete event
    handling in inner loop with python code. Also move (previously
    machine independent) PyErr_CheckSignals here, so we can propagate
    exceptions in event handling code.

    MACDEPPATH: Remove `sharedmodules' from default value of this variable
    since calculate_path() in getpath.c will automatically add this.

Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Thu Jun 12 15:29:46 1997 +0000

    Make imports faster on the Mac, by
    - Remembering whether sys.path components refer to files or folders,
    - Using mac-specific code to check for file existence, in stead of trying
      to fopen() each possible file.
    
    These mods need an accompanying mod to import.c.

    Use TRY_RUN, not TRY_COMPILE, to test for -Olimit (on Solaris,
    with Sun's cc, the compile succeeds, but the link fails).
    
    Test for IRIX*/6* instead of for IRIX/6* -- on 64-bit IRIX systems,
    uname returns IRIX64.

    Packer.pack_uhyper(): Fixes needed to properly pack unsigned 64 bit
    longs where the top bit is set.  First, change the masks so that they
    are `L' longs, otherwise the sign bits will get propagated to the
    result.  Next, do not coerce to int before sending to pack_uint()
    otherwise Python will generate an OverflowError.  Here is a test
    program that fails without the patch, but now succeeds:
    
    import xdrlib
    
    addr = (132, 151, 1, 71)
    uint = 0L
    for a in addr:
        uint = (uint << 8) | a
    
    ulong64 = uint << 32
    
    p = xdrlib.Packer()
    p.pack_uhyper(ulong64)
    buf = p.get_buffer()
    u = xdrlib.Unpacker(buf)
    ulong64prime = u.unpack_uhyper()
    
    if ulong64 == ulong64prime:
        print 'okay'
    else:
        print 'bogus'
    
    print ulong64, ulong64prime

    Renamed a local variable from 'PyCFunction' (which is also a typedef

Date:   Tue May 20 18:21:34 1997 +0000

    Got rid of c_error in favor of errno (and EDOM/ERANGE).
    Assume that errno usage is thread-safe -- most vendors do this by
    making in a macro that refers to a per-thread storage area.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri May 16 16:21:38 1997 +0000

    Address the following problem on DOS and Win 3.1, reported by Jim
    Ahlstrom:
    
    Arraymodule.c has static functions H_getitem and h_getitem, and a
    few others which differ only in case.  These are a problem on
    Windows 3.1, since a case-sensitive link causes Winsock to fail
    (hey, it's not my fault).  Please convert H_etc to HH_etc etc.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri May 16 14:23:33 1997 +0000

    Got rid of all the last_name_* bogosities.  I don't think the
    complexity saved much any more.  A simple benchmark (grail) showed
    that there were 3 times as many misses as hits, and the same number of
    times again the code was bypassed altogether due to the existence of
    setattro/getattro.

    Catch nis.error and raise TestFailed instead.  This catches the
    problem where Python is configured with the nismodule but NIS isn't
    installed, or the map names don't correspond to those hardcoded in
    nismodule.c (which is bogus in and of itself).

    Fix big ineficciency in regobj.search/match (introduced by Barry in an
    otherwise laudible attempt to rationalize the argument parsing): it
    would save a copy of the original string instead of a reference to it.
    Go back to saving a reference, but keep the "s#" format (using a hack
    that involves two argument parsing steps, first using "O", then using
    "s#").

commit 789a1613a08d6d6891a40ca1800eaba217eea6bf
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat May 10 22:33:55 1997 +0000

    Add optional 'sizehint' argument to readlines().  After approximately
    this many bytes have been read, readlines stops.  Because of
    buffering, the amount of bytes read is usually at least 8K more than
    the hint.
    
    Also changed read() and readline() to use PyArg_ParseTuple().
    
    (Note that the *previous* checkin also fixed error handling and
    narrowed the range of thread unblocking for all methods using
    fread().)

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri May 9 22:27:31 1997 +0000

    Speed up read() (i.e. read till EOF) considerably by doing a stat() to
    see if we can guess the #bytes until the end of the file.  If we
    can't, increment the buffer size increments up to 0.5Meg to avoid
    realloc'ing too much.

    Used operators from abstract.h where possible (arithmetic operators,
    get/set/del item).  This removes a pile of duplication.  There's no
    abstract operator for 'not' but I removed the function call for it
    anyway -- it's a little faster in-line.

    Misc.__init__():  Removed method, replaced with class attribute (which
            was all that the method set anyway).  Removed calls to the

    Hm.  What was previously checked in was the edited *output* of the old
    cgen.py.  Now that cgen.py and cstubs have been quickly renamed, check
    in the actual output.  This has some "old-style" names left in
    (getilongarg etc.) but these are now take care of by macros in
    cgensupport.h (which is now specific to glmodule.c).

    Restore two features of the original 1.4 pickle:
    
    - which_module() search __main__ last;
    
    - load_inst() no longer checks that the classname really refers to a class.

    Alas, I have to restore 'marshal', since it is needed by the new
    cPickle-compatible pickle, and pickle must be importable in restricted
    mode.  I guess I'll have to make marshal safe.

    Expand one level of symbolic link in sys.argv[0] before inserting its
    dirname in sys.path.  This means that you can create a symbolic link
    foo in /usr/local/bin pointing to /usr/yourname/src/foo/foo.py, and
    then invoking foo will insert /usr/yourname/src/foo in sys.path, not
    /usr/local/bin.  This makes it easier to have multifile programs
    (before, the program would have to do an os.readlink(sys.argv[0])
    itself and insert the resulting directory in sys.path -- Grail does
    this).
    
    Note that the expansion is only used for sys.path; sys.argv[0] is
    still the original, unadorned filename (/usr/local/bin/foo in the
    example).

    Muchly changed and improved pprint.py:
    
            - handles recursive data structures
            - formatting based on a PrettyPrinter object
            - allows a maximum nesting depth to be specified
            - provides safe repr()-like function which does not pretty-print

    Change in when and how stdin and stdout are set to line-buffering.
    This used to be done whenever stdin was interactive.  Now we only do
    it when the -i flag is given.  Also (and this is the real reason for
    this fix) we explicitly allocate a buffer -- this seems to be
    necessary on Windows.

    From: Clarence Gardner <clarence@king.silcom.com>
    
    The function parse_qs currently calls urllib.unquote on the
    value of the field submitted, but not on the name.  It needs
    to do both.

    The default path components are now all relative instead of absolute paths.
    
    This completes the getpath.c checkin.  Note that to enable this in an
    existing build tree, you'll have to edit your Setup and Setup.in file
    to remove the $(DESTLIB) from all the PATH variable definitions.

Date:   Fri Apr 11 17:18:45 1997 +0000

    Completely revamped the way the default path is constructed.
    
    Idea and first three implementation rounds due to Barry -- after that
    I spent another day on it, hopefully it's enough for now :-)
    
    (Wait for the checkin to Setup.in.)

commit f73bab7f9665beacb0bd95c068129448a833fe2c
Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Thu Apr 3 14:51:03 1997 +0000

    Added an attribute string_id_to_buffer, which gives the offset you
    have to add to the id() of a string to get the address of the
    data. This is a horrible and error-prone hack, but unfortunately it is
    one that is needed for playing audio and crearing pixmaps. Having the
    constant here is at least marginally better than the previous practice
    of having the constant 16 all over the place...

    Guido, I hope I'm not stomping too far afield, but these seem pretty clear

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Apr 2 05:49:46 1997 +0000

    Changed my mind on replace().
    It's now replace(str, old, new, maxsplit=0).
    Note new ordering of parameters (string first);
    this is more consistent with translate().

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Mar 31 17:19:40 1997 +0000

    Remove ConflictError (which was also removed from bltinmodule.c, even
    though the checkin message failed to note that).

commit 9199f62aa1153d9c13ed97a94185a80666125303

commit c6472e9ee161c3bbc003dbf8ce3f74ec8f700eb9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Mar 31 17:15:43 1997 +0000

    1. Add string conversions to int(), long(), float().  (Not to complex()!)
    
    2. Fix two bugs in complex():
    
       - Memory leak when using complex(classinstance) -- r was never
       DECREF'ed.
    
       - Conversion of the second argument, if not complex, was done using
       the type vector of the 1st.

commit dddf7a6fb4f2486a5fbb06acafb3223424e95145
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Mar 31 17:13:17 1997 +0000

    Added test of complex() (that catches a bug in 1.4!).
    
    Added test that ensures that int() and long() truncate float numbers
    towards zero.

Date:   Tue Mar 25 21:58:08 1997 +0000

    Change by Andrew Kuchling (edited by Guido):
    
    Removed unused import tempfile.
    
    Added some docstrings.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 25 18:25:20 1997 +0000

    Added two new questions about number conversions.

Author: Roger E. Masse <rmasse@newcnri.cnri.reston.va.us>
Date:   Tue Mar 25 17:39:56 1997 +0000

    As per GvR recomendation, added support for a 'sync' attribute for the
    GDBM module.

commit 1eb9a81eb92dd5d133c8584bad8aecd5b8f0ccd1
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 25 16:50:31 1997 +0000

    Added new functions replace() and replace1().

commit c8a80cdbad5d925400615e09c4bf720de5976181
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 25 16:41:31 1997 +0000

    Added docs for replace() and replace1().

commit 4fc706705521cd8fed60a0403c903a377516ea95
Author: Roger E. Masse <rmasse@newcnri.cnri.reston.va.us>
Date:   Tue Mar 25 16:06:03 1997 +0000

    Added a 'sync' method to shelve.  If the underlying database does not have a sync
    attribute, this method silently ignores this fact.  The default (bsddb's dbhash) does.

commit e8e87999ab6ed6aa5aac921fc2e262de618829d9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 25 15:25:54 1997 +0000

    Remove untrue statement about . and .. being included in list of names
    passed to walk() visitor.

commit fb8f1cadb279d34860d31f67813e4b405411d3da
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 21 21:55:12 1997 +0000

    Add clear() method to dictionary objects.

commit 3ee6b195bbe8272b5901f3f97c0966ddd4bb72fa
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 21 21:18:16 1997 +0000

    Removed 'marshal' from the list of "ok" built-in functions -- the
    unmarshalling code is actually rather naive and can easily be
    caused to crash by feeding it invalid data.  This should be fixed in
    the marshal module, but I don't have the time to fix it now :-(

commit bcd91e07d10f8773c9e378453bdbf7f7996b9ba8

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 20 19:46:41 1997 +0000

    Added __assert__.

commit eb8c972648c9fec8bad5419eb1ab13cafa52d3d8
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 20 19:45:51 1997 +0000

    Ka-Ping Yee's version is better:
    
    Here's a "keyword" module which, in the spirit of "token.py", updates
    the list of keywords automatically from a source file (in this case,
    "graminit.c" seemed like a reasonable choice, easier than "Grammar/Grammar").
    
    You get "kwlist", a sorted list of keywords; "kwdict", a dictionary
    mapping each keyword to 1; and "iskeyword", a function which tells
    you if a given string happens to be a keyword.

commit 90d556fb6e71ca05b14c514b0c9a53a99839a3e0
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sun Mar 16 00:37:59 1997 +0000

    New long_lshift, without restriction on size of shift count, by Tim Peters.
    This makes it possible to write 1L<<1000000, memory permitting.

commit e053c677801209c000831e8d306c01c3460f9a57
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 05:09:30 1997 +0000

    Remove err_input -- there is no such global!

commit 45b83915f8d5974045d374c981531d9b98570df1
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 04:32:50 1997 +0000

    New form of PyFPE_END_PROTECT macro.

    Include setjmp.h so it compiles if WANT_SIGFPE_HANDLER is undefined.

commit f0958064f9159b1170ff4ddb87fb9230ec944d05
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 04:25:22 1997 +0000

    Remove redundant references to thread stuff -- long, long ago, there
    was some locking code in this file that needed it...

commit 74277916a970dabf70b9ac95d92cae78f25938ed
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 04:24:08 1997 +0000

    Add Macros defining new names for all external symbols.

commit 1f06beeeddea2abefe6ab10ced35d7c4186f9940
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 04:23:42 1997 +0000

    Change PyFPE_END_PROTECT to PyFPE_END_PROTECT(v).  v should be the
    last variable to which a floating point expression is assigned.  The
    macro passes its address to a dummy function so that the optimizer
    can't delay calculating its value until after the macro.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 04:18:20 1997 +0000

    Change the list() function to match the documentation in the comment
    (it should return a list of tuples, not a list of lists).

commit 56d1e3a517981562904113765f2eca361a1c6d19
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 04:16:54 1997 +0000

    Added Fred Drake's netrc parser class.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 14 04:15:43 1997 +0000

    target libinstall:
            Create the .pyo files corresponding to the .py and .pyc files as
            well.

commit ef8dc06c01e71889122d7cfb2590cde12b8a9515
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 13 14:13:16 1997 +0000

    compile():  Use the __debug__ flag to determine the proper filename extension
            to use for the cached module code object.

commit 6af0c00ab671aa6e276c9bbd20b9b71d9ae96264
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 11 21:25:55 1997 +0000

    Fix dumb bug calling parsestrplus with wrong node as argument.
    
    Add prototypes for parsestr() and parsestrplus() (unrelated, but
    seemed to make sense.)

commit 1c6a459921b3fbc04f818b95f277302336573dde
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 11 18:43:26 1997 +0000

    Define __debug__ as 0 if -O is given, 1 otherwise.  Also test for
    errors in initializing the dictionary.

commit 7c53111d5b74dbd46ec1acf2328f0ce67732324b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 11 18:42:21 1997 +0000

    Added support for ``if __debug__:'' -- if -O is given, this form is
    recognized by the code generator and code generation for the test and
    the subsequent suite is suppressed.
    
    One must write *exactly* ``if __debug__:'' or ``elif __debug__:'' --
    no parentheses or operators must be present, or the optimization is
    not carried through.  Whitespace doesn't matter.  Other uses of
    __debug__ will find __debug__ defined as 0 or 1 in the __builtin__
    module.

commit 0824f63cfc4336b9fc6ff6e2f067a9fcd80aa162
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Mar 10 23:17:01 1997 +0000

    Added support for imaginary constants (e.g. 0j, 1j, 1.0j).

commit c43b6850544af69c1d489d23c5dbc9cab7aea5e8
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 7 21:05:43 1997 +0000

    Restore old behavior of autotest and testall, using regrtest.
    This is done for backward compatibility with Python 1.4.

commit f58ed2596706b97c16174a839c1ed6f6b1f87fa6
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 7 21:04:33 1997 +0000

    Add "extra-verbose" mode, triggered by specifying two -v flags.  In
    this mode, all tests are run in verbose mode with their output to
    stdout.  No comparing of output is done.

commit e69be3eb93f5fdb6d65b34bde5b4ac871002cf30
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Mar 7 20:30:03 1997 +0000

    Much more rigorous testing -- we now try many times, varying in time
    of day, day of week, and season.
    
    Fix the weekday predictions -- these seemed to be all bogus.  The new
    predictions seem to correspond with strftime() on Solaris and IRIX, so
    I believe they are correct.
    
    Get rid of the test for non-standard format %C returning "the same as
    date(1)".  This is hard to do reliably without opening a pipe to date,
    and moreover, on IRIX 6.2, %C yields the Century.  So we use that
    instead.  (We don't complain about this in non-verbose mode anyway.)

    Add casts to CMPERROR macro to silence SunPro compiler warnings about
    integer overflow in << operator.

commit 82598051e6831fadad5f27a20f24f484a54691f3
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 5 00:20:32 1997 +0000

Date:   Tue Feb 18 21:53:32 1997 +0000

    Restructured quite a bit, hopefully Lee Busby will find this useful.
    Also grandly renamed.
    
    Here's the new interface:
    
    When WITH_READLINE is defined, two functions are defined:
    
      - PyOS_GnuReadline (what used to be my_readline() with WITH_READLINE)
      - PyOS_ReadlineInit (for Dave Ascher)
    
    Always, these functions are defined:
    
      - PyOS_StdioReadline (what used to be my_readline() without WITH_READLINE)
      - PyOS_Readline (the interface used by tokenizer.c and [raw_]input().
    
    There's a global function pointer PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer,
    initialized to NULL.  When PyOS_Readline finds this to be NULL, it
    sets it to either PyOS_GnuReadline or PyOS_StdioReadline depending on
    which one makes more sense (i.e. it uses GNU only if it is defined
    *and* stdin is indeed a tty device).
    
    An embedding program that has its own wishes can set the function
    pointer to a function of its own design.  It should take a char*
    prompt argument (which may be NULL) and return a string *ending in a
    \n character* -- or "" for EOF or NULL for a user interrupt.

    Require _tkinter -- don't attempt to import tkinter when _tkinter does
    not exist.  All 8 uses of tkinter are replaced with _tkinter.  Still
    create a variable tkinter though, because that is used by other
    modules importing Tkinter (e.g. tkinter.createfilehandler()).
    
    Also added a comment to the 'import _tkinter' line saying that if this
    fails, Python is not configured correctly.

    My version of Lee Busby's patches to make '-i' pretend stdin is a tty
    even if it isn't.  Changes:
    
    - set the global flag Py_InteractiveFlag when -i is given
    - call Py_FdIsInteractive() instead of isatty()
    - make stdin unbuffered, too, when using -u
    - make stdin and stdout line buffered, when stdin is interactive and not -u
    
    Note that setting the environment variable PYTHONINSPECT does not have
    these extra effects of -i.  (Should it?)
    
    Unlike Lee's changes, I don't set change the prompt to go to stderr
    when -i is given.

commit 7433b12a5ca8c1c6a6685160edb09efbf61c4544
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Feb 14 19:45:36 1997 +0000

    Added new global flag variable Py_InteractiveFlag and new function
    Py_FdIsInteractive().  The flag is supposed to be set by the -i
    command line option.  The function is supposed to be called instead of
    isatty().  This is used for Lee Busby's wish #1, to have an option
    that pretends stdin is interactive even when it really isn't.

    *Don't* kill all local variables on function exit.  This will be done
    by the frameobject dealloc when it is time for the locals to go.  When
    there's still a traceback object referencing this stack frame, we
    don't want the local variables to disappear yet.
    
    (Hmm...  Shouldn't they be copied to the f_locals dictionary?)

    Slight tweak: in string_hash(), if the hash hasn't been computed yet,
    and if there's a pointer to an interned version of the string, use its
    hash and store its hash in this object, rather than recomputing it.

    Changes by Sjoerd (reformatted).
    
    add(): better handling of overflow (substitute maxval instead of
    throwing away higher order bits).
    
    ratecv(): some bugfixes, Sjoerd says.

    Put support for a cnf dictionary back in, since it is still supported
    by all true Tkinter widgets.  (Not that I *like* this module -- it
    stinks, but until I have something better, I can't nuke it.)

    Merged in Jack's fixes.  This brings some lines beyond 79 chars again;
    I'll clean that up later.  Also corrected a mistake introduced by the
    previous reformatting: an 'else' belonging to a 'for' was accidentally
    reindented to belong to the 'if' inside the 'for'.  Note that the
    module uses inconsistent indentation -- most code is indented with 8
    spaces, but some of the reformatted code uses 4 spaces.  I'll fix this
    later in the promised cleanup pass.

    The USE_CACHE_ALIGNING define now has a value: the number of *words*
    in a cacheline.

commit af310c1d008885a7412fbcae9ba3c58092dd04b4
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sun Feb 2 23:30:32 1997 +0000

    Restructured Checker class to get rid of 'ext' table.
    Links are now either in 'todo' or 'done', and ext links
    are hadled more like local links except that no further
    links are gathered (and sometimes they aren't checked,
    e.g. for mailto and news URLs).  The -x option reverses
    its meaning: it disables checking of ext links (they are
    moved to 'done' without checking).  A new 'errors' table
    collects pages with bad links as we go -- redundant,
    but useful for the GUI version which needs to report
    this as we go.  Some new methods, including reset().
    New checkpoint format.
    
    Adapted the GUI to the changes in the Checker class.
    Added Quit and "Start over" buttons, and a checkbox
    to disable checking external links.  The details
    window now also shows bad links emanating from the
    selected page.  Miscellaneous small chages.

    Many misc changes.
    
    - Faster HTML parser derivede from SGMLparser (Fred Gansevles).
    
    - All manipulations of todo, done, ext, bad are done via methods, so a
    derived class can override.  Also moved the 'done' marking to
    dopage(), so run() is much simpler.
    
    - Added a method status() which returns a string containing the
    summary counts; added a "total" count.
    
    - Drop the guessing of the file type before opening the document -- we
    still need to check those links for validity!
    
    - Added a subroutine to close a connection which first slurps up the
    remaining data when it's an ftp URL -- apparently closing an ftp
    connection without reading till the end makes it hang.
    
    - Added -n option to skip running (only useful with -R).
    
    - The Checker object now has an instance variable which is set to 1
    when it is changed.  This is not pickled.

    Changed the lookup algorithm again, based on Reimer Behrends's post.
    The table size is now constrained to be a power of two, and we use a
    variable increment based on GF(2^n)-{0} (not that I have the faintest
    idea what that is :-) which helps avoid the expensive '%' operation.
    
    Some of the entries in the table of polynomials have been modified
    according to a post by Tim Peters.

    Two small changes:
    
    - Use co->... instead of f->f_code->...; save an extra lookup of what
    we already have in a local variable).
    
    - Remove test for nlocals > 0 before setting fastlocals to
    f->f_localsplus; 0 is a rare case and the assignment is safe even
    then.

commit da4eb5c3b55df9b7d6957ddd0458313102f0a92e
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Jan 24 03:43:35 1997 +0000

    Instead of emitting SET_LINENO instructions, generate a line number
    table which is incorporated in the code object.  This way, the runtime
    overhead to keep track of line numbers is only incurred when an
    exception has to be reported.

    Add co_firstlineno and co_lnotab, for the line number table generated
    by the compiler (in lieu of SET_LINENO instructions).

    Initialize the ob_type field of PyAST_Type dynamically (in
    initparser()) instead of statically (in the initializer).  The static
    initialization, using the address of an object in a different DLL, is
    too much for the Microsoft VC++ compiler, and we want to be able to
    build this module as a separate DLL (it's nice to have but we don't
    want to increase the core DLL's size by 25K).  This same trick has
    been applied to a number of modules, e.g. NumPy and _tkinter.

    Forget keeping track of whether a dictionary contains all interned
    string keys.  Just doing a pointer compare before the string compare
    (in fact before the hash compare!) is just as fast.

    Only call sigcheck() at the ticker code if we don't have true signals.
    This is safe now that both intrcheck() and signalmodule.c schedule a
    sigcheck() call via Py_AddPendingCall().
    
    This gives another 7% speedup (never run such a test twice ;-).

    Changes for frame object speedup:
    
    - get fastlocals differently
    - call newframeobject() with fewer arguments
    - toss getowner(), which was unused anyway

commit f3e85a0356e679ed9ff8d13236ff8e9f77a9fd0b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 20 04:20:52 1997 +0000

    Changes that appear to give another 12% speedup.
    
    Rather than allocating a list object for the fast locals and another
    (extensible one) for the value stack and allocating the block stack
    dynamically, allocate the block stack with a fixed size (CO_MAXBLOCKS
    from compile.h), and stick the locals and value stack at the end of
    the object (this is now possible since the stack size is known
    beforehand).  Get rid of the owner field and the nvalues argument --
    it is available in the code object, like nlocals.
    
    This requires small changes in ceval.c only.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Sat Jan 18 07:53:23 1997 +0000

    Two speedup hacks.  Caching the hash saves recalculation of a string's
    hash value.  Interning strings (which requires hash caching) tries to
    ensure that only one string object with a given value exists, so
    equality tests are one pointer comparison.  Together, these can speed
    the interpreter up by as much as 20%.  Each costs the size of a long
    or pointer per string object.  In addition, interned strings live
    until the end of times.  If you are concerned about memory footprint,
    simply comment the #define out here (and rebuild everything!).

    disco(...) is an alias for disassemble(...), for backward compatibility.

    As per GvR recomendations, remove the restriction that binhex only run on
    big-endian machines.  This is done by directing the struct module's pack
    and unpack methods to treat the data always in bin endian format.
    This has been tested on irix (big endian) and solaris x86 (little endian)
    but not yet on the mac.

    set_key(): Use Py_CHARMASK macro to get the character from the array
    unsigned.  This fixes the 8bit-char-in-key platform incompatibility.
    
    I also removed the old backwards compatibility code, and the commented
    lisp rotor code.  I retained the lisp docstrings as comments preceding
    each function.

    Modified to use 'rgbimg' instead of the SGI specific 'imgfile' for reading
    the imagefiles and converting tham to a format suitable for imageop.  Also
    added two more tests 'rgb2rgb8' and 'rgb82rgb' which remove the dependence
    on the file 'greytest.rgb'.
    
    Note: test_imgfile.py still uses 'greytest.rgb'

    Eliminated gcc -Wall complaints:
    
        - Quieted gcc -Wall by removing unused local variables.
    
        - Added some choice parentheses around assignments in conditional
          tests.
    
        - Removed an unused (and seemingly unreachable) err label in
          load_short_binstring().
    
        - in Unpickler_load(), removed \. in string format.
    
        - init_stuff() was declared to return an int, but had these
          problems:
    
            - it was returning NULL instead of 0 or 1 in some cases
            - it was falling of the end of the routine without returning
              anything
            - the call of init_stuff() in initcPickle() was never checking
              the return value anyway.
    
          I changed all this by returning 1 in the case of errors, 0 when
          no error occurred.  Then in initcPickle(), if init_stuff()
          returns non-zero, I call Py_FatalError().
    
    Suppressing my urge to reformat according to Python coding standards!

    New strop_joinfields implementation, highly optimized for Lists.  All
    other sequences use the Sequence protocol from the abstract API.  The
    algorithm has changed so that only one pass through the sequences are
    made.

    Rewrote translate() as follows:
            - 'delete' is a C++ keyword; use 'del_table' instead
            - apply Py_CHARMASK() to del_table[i] before using it as an index
              *** this fixes a bug that was just reported on the list ***
            - if the translation didn't make any changes, INCREF and return
              the original string
            - when del_table is empty or omitted, don't copy the translation
              table to a table of ints (should be a bit faster)
    
    Rewrote maketrans() to avoid copying the table (2-3% faster).

    strop_upper(), strop_lower(): shared code version caused to much of a

    strop_joinfields(): re-instate optimizations for lists and tuples, but
    support arbitrary other kinds of sequences as well.

    Fix the following bug:
    
    - When dragging the mouse in either listbox, the *first* entry
    clicked on is selected rather than the last (but the last one is
    highlighted).
    
    This is done by changing the bindtags so that our binding is executed
    after the default binding (which sets the 'active' index to the last
    item selected), and using 'active' instead of 'anchor' as the index to
    ask for.

    Several changes:
    
    - split_whitespace(): slightly better memory ref handling when errors
      occur.
    
    - strop_joinfields(): First argument can now be any sequence-protocol
      conformant object.
    
    - strop_find(), strop_rfind(): Use PyArg_ParseTuple for optional
      arguments
    
    - strop_lower(), strop_upper(): Factor logic into a common function
      do_casechange().
    
    - strop_atoi(), strop_atol(): Use PyArg_ParseTuple.
    
    - strop_maketrans(): arguments used to be optional, although the
      documentation doesn't reflect this.  Make the source conform to the
      docs.  Arguments are required, but two empty strings will return the
      identity translation table.
    
    - General pass fixing up formatting, and checking for return values.

    Some small changes.
    
    Raise ImportError instead of SystemExit when $DISPLAY is not set, so
    regrtest.py will do the right thing.
    
    Add a call to gl.clear() to clear the window before drawing in it.
    
    Add some verbose prints for completeness.
    
    Use gl.v2i() for the coordinates of one of the lines, for a little bit
    of variety.
    
    Reduce the time the window is displayed from 5 to 2 seconds.

    - Fixed a bug in signal.pause() so that exceptions raised in signal
      handlers are now properly caught after pause() returns.
    
    - Removed SIGCPU and SIGFSZ.  We surmise that these were typos for the
      previously missing SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ.

    Ok, ok, I've fixed gradual underflow on packing too.

    Use the new struct module's ability to pack and unpack standardized
    data formats.  The _xdr module is no longer used, since struct
    supports the required IEEE floats and doubles.
    
    (I have one doubt about not using _xdr.  The struct module doesn't
    handle Inf, NaN and gradual underflow correctly.  If the _xdr module
    does these things better, it may still have a (small) competitive
    advantage.  On the other hand, since not all platforms support IEEE
    floating point, it's not clear that it would be a good idea to ever
    transfer Inf or NaNs.  Gradual underflow can be fixed in the struct
    module.

    (formatter.py):  Add a flush() method to the writer interface.  This really
            needs to be a standard part of the interface, so we'll have it in
            for the next release.

    Added better handling of unsigned longs -- a Python long returned by
    unpack('L', ...) is now acceptable to pack('L', ...).

commit 36bb181cdffbb80b555fd8454c80e66e10657dde
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 31 05:57:34 1996 +0000

    Rewrote _{read,write}_{short,long} to use the newly revamped struct
    module.  (Small problem: struct.pack() won't deal with the Python long
    ints returned by struct.unpack() for the 'L' format.  Worked around
    that for now.)

    Fix the first bugs...  treatment of 0 count was wrong, and memchr()
    should be memset().

commit f7e6b4b38872fb848b7c834010ec23ec59826e43
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 31 01:41:25 1996 +0000

    Pretty much rewritten to fulfull several long-standing wishes:
    
    -- The whole implementation is now more table-driven.
    
    -- Unsigned integers.  Format characters 'B', 'H', 'I' and 'L'
    mean unsigned byte, short, int and long.  For 'I' and 'L', the return
    value is a Python long integer if a Python plain integer can't
    represent the required range (note: this is dependent on the size of
    the relevant C types only, not of the sign of the actual value).
    
    -- A new format character 's' packs/unpacks a string.  When given a
    count prefix, this is the size of the string, not a repeat count like
    for the other format characters; e.g. '10s' means a single 10-byte
    string, while '10c' means 10 characters.  For packing, the string is
    truncated or padded with null bytes as appropriate to make it fit.
    For unpacking, the resulting string always has exactly the specified
    number of bytes.  As a special case, '0s' means a single, empty
    string (while '0c' means 0 characters).
    
    -- Various byte order options.  The first character of the format
    string determines the byte order, size and alignment, as follows:
    
    First character         Byte order              size and alignment
    
            '@'             native                  native
            '='             native                  standard
            '<'             little-endian           standard
            '>'             big-endian              standard
            '!'             network (= big-endian)  standard
    
    If the first character is not one of these, '@' is assumed.
    
    Native byte order is big-endian or little-endian, depending on the
    host system (e.g. Motorola and Sun are big-endian; Intel and DEC are
    little-endian).
    
    Native size and alignment are determined using the C compiler's sizeof
    expression.  This is always combined with native byte order.
    
    Standard size and alignment are as follows: no alignment is required
    for any type (so you have to use pad bytes); short is 2 bytes; int and
    long are 4 bytes.  In this mode, there is no support for float and
    double.
    
    Note the difference between '@' and '=': both use native byte order,
    but the size and alignment of the latter is standardized.
    
    The form '!' is available for those poor souls who can't remember
    whether network byte order is big-endian or little-endian.
    
    There is no way to indicate non-native byte order (i.e. force
    byte-swapping); use the appropriate choice of '<' or '>'.

    gl is a *huge* module.  This is a very simple test that insures that
    all the modules attributes are present and creates a small criss-cross
    window for 5 seconds (example from the documentation :-)  A more
    comprehensive test would probably be useful... but maybe overkill.

    From reading the source, it turns out that the setkey() method can
    take an optional string key, but if key is not given, the method does
    nothing!  In the rewrite (see upcoming check-in), I left things this
    way, but here I document that this is the case.

    Several changes.  Test program to follow.
    
    - Where optional arguments were being used, converted to
      PyArg_ParseTuple() style instead of nested PyArg_Parse() style.
    
    - Check for and handle many potential error conditions that were never
      being tested.
    
    - internal reg_* functions renamed to regobj_* (makes it easier to
      figure out which are global regex functions and which are for regex
      objects).
    
    - reg_group (now regobj_group) was quite extensively reworked.  it no
      longer recurses to do its job (by factoring core functionality into
      a separate function that knows about string and integer indexes).
    
    - some minor formatting fixes.
    
    - regex_set_syntax() now invalidates the cache.  Without this change
      (in the example below), the second search would produce different
      output depending on whether the first search were performed or not
      (since performing the first search would cache the compiled object
      with RE_SYNTAX_EMACS, causing the second test to unexpectedly fail).
    
      regex.search('(a+)|(b+)', 'cdb')
      prev = regex.set_syntax(RE_SYNTAX_AWK)
      regex.search('(a+)|(b+)', 'cdb')

    PySequence_Index(): set exception when object is not found in

    operator.indexOf([4, 3, 2, 1], 9) would raise a SystemError!

    Another fix for Split() -- don't refuse {"} but turn it into ".
    This is needed because if a configure option has " as its value,
    it will be rendered as {"}; after stripping one level of quoting it's
    just ", on which splitlist will barf.

            <leonard@dstc.edu.au>; allows hyphen and period in the middle
            of attribute names.  Still not allowed as first character;
            as first character these are illegal in the Reference Concrete

            the first char in an attribute name in deployment on the web.

    SIGCPU and SIGFSZ but we're (Jeremy and I) are actually unsure whether

    Test for the dl module.  This only works for SunOS and Solaris.
    I've attempted to make a test that silently exits if either
    module dl is not present, we're not on a Sun OS, or a standard
    shared library ('/usr/lib/libresolv.so') is not found...  Otherwise,
    It does a simple test of dlmodule on that library.  I *think*
    this would be ok to add to testall.py but I'll wait till I hear
    some feedback on the liberalness of this approach.

    don't need the if test for verbosity when checking for results of an
    unsupported option.

    Hmm, now that I think about it, we *can* use time.time() and 'date' if
    running verbose.

    More or less portabilized.
    
    1. If a conversion isn't supported on the current platform, just
       ignore it, unless running as a script (i.e. verbose)
    
    2. Don't use time.time() and os.popen('date') to get the raw values.
       These will always be different!

    Several changes... Guido *please* take a look!
    
    1. Renamed
    
    2. Several coding styles were being used here, owing to the multiple
       contributors.  I tried to convert everything to standard "python"
       coding style for indentation, paren and brace placement, etc.
    
    3. There were several potential error conditions that were never being
       checked, and where I saw them, I added checks of return values,
       etc.  I'm pretty sure I got them all.
    
    4. There were some old-style (pre PyArg_ParseTuple) argument
       extraction and these were converted to use PyArg_ParseTuple.
    
    All changes compile and run with the new test_select.py module, at
    least on my Solaris/Sparc box.

    nis_maplist(): Use check of yp_get_default_domain() return value
    that's used in other parts of this module.
    
    nis_maps(): use PyArg_NoArgs().

commit adbf4e66df714efecbf8f3cfd3c849fc043b4323
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Wed Dec 11 00:15:58 1996 +0000

    Renamed, and bug fixed:
    
    Two interesting problems in nis_maplist().  First, it is possible that
    clnt_create() will return NULL.  This was being caught, but no Python
    error was being set.  I use clnt_spcreateerror() to generate the value
    of the exception.
    
    But why would clnt_create() fail?  It's because no server was being
    found.  And why was this?  It was because nis_maplist() tried only to
    get the NIS master for the first map in the aliases list, which is
    passwd.byname, and guess what?  That's the one NIS map CNRI does *not*
    export!  So the yp_master() call was failing to return a valid
    server.  I now cycle through all the map aliases until I find a valid
    master.  If not, a different exception is set.
    
    I'm not sure this is the completely correct way to do all this, but
    short of rewriting the entire nismodule.c (to expose the proper API to
    Python), it should do the trick.

    Added new quicksort implementation, tailored to sorting arrays of
    object pointers.  Should be a bit faster than the C library's qsort(),
    and doesn't have the prohibition on recursion that Solaris qsort() has
    in the threaded version of their C library.
    
    Thanks to discussions with Tim Peters.

    New regression testing harness.
    
    (testall.out): obsolete.  see individual test output files in the
    Output directory.
    
    (testall.py): now contains only the list of all tests
    
    (autotest.py): The new testing harness.  Supports -g option to
    generate output files instead of verifying; -w option to warn about
    non-tested optional modules; additional command line arguments to
    generate or test individual tests (useful for generating output file
    of new tests).

commit 0aa9ee65ab66627c2d065d213090aec93e634ee9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Dec 10 18:07:35 1996 +0000

    Moved the raise logic out of the main interpreter loop to a separate function.
    
    The raise logic has one additional feature: if you raise <class>,
    <value> where <value> is not an instance, it will construct an
    instance using <value> as argument.  If <value> is None, <class> is
    instantiated without arguments.  If <value> is a tuple, it is used as
    the argument list.
    
    This feature is intended to make it easier to upgrade code from using
    string exceptions to using class exceptions; without this feature,
    you'd have to change every raise statement from ``raise X'' to ``raise
    X()'' and from ``raise X, y'' to ``raise X(y)''.  The latter is still
    the recommended form (because it has no ambiguities about the number
    of arguments), but this change makes the transition less painful.

    A test of the `new' module.  The new.code() test is fairly bogus since
    I'm really not sure what the proper inputs are.  I do flex the
    function call though by passing in arguments of the proper type.  I
    don't try to exec the code object that gets returned!

    Renamed, ungrandly.  We don't have the GNU MP library here so we can't
    really test this module, or even compile it without a lot of work.
    
    I'll make a note of it that this has not been tested!

    C coding standard for Python C files.
    
    Currently fairly minimal, but I'll be adding to this as needed.  I
    think it's pretty darn close.
    
    To use this, just load the file and in a C buffer type:
    
    M-x c-set-style RET python RET
    
    [there are ways to automate much of this!]

            the comma must represent a bug in the modified process_command()
            function, but I haven't found it yet.  This will work for now.

    Tentative changes to make this work better on 64-bit machines.
    A plain int that doesn't fit in 32 bits will be marshalled using a new
    type.  32 bits machines can't handle this and will issue a warning.

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Thu Dec 5 22:28:43 1996 +0000

    (libparser.tex):  Added note that the line number for a terminal token
            indicates the line on which the token ends rather than starts
            (a side effect of interpreting the parse tree nodes directly).
            Maybe I'll fix this for Python 2.0.

Date:   Thu Dec 5 21:55:55 1996 +0000

    Experimental new implementation of dictionary comparison.  This
    defines that a shorter dictionary is always smaller than a longer one.
    For dictionaries of the same size, the smallest differing element
    determines the outcome (which yields the same results as before,
    without explicit sorting).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 14 18:24:47 1996 +0000

    Fixed a bug: files that no longer exist remotely would never be
    removed from .mirrorinfo.  Now they are (even if -r is not specified
    -- the files are not removed, just their .mirrorinfo entry).
    
    Added a feature: the -s pattern option is also used to skip local
    files when removing (i.e. -r won't remove local files matching the -s
    patterns).

Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 11 21:03:01 1996 +0000

    (Makefile):  Updated comments about using LaTeX2HTML for the library
            reference.  Made the extension to the input files for makeindex
            explicit; if not made explicit a directory of the given base
            name can cause makeindex to blow up.  Specifically, if there is
            a directory ./lib/ created by LaTeX2HTML, "makeindex lib" will
            fail, but "makeindex lib.idx" will not.
    
            l2h{tut,ext,lib} are now dependent on myformat.perl.
    
            l2h adds ls2lib and removes the non-existant l2href.

    (fix_libaux.sed):  Hackish little sed script to modify lib.aux to get section
            numbers right for latex2html for section titles which include
            "\sectcode{__.*__}" in the name.  Perhaps less general than it should
            be, but sufficient.

    (.latex2html-init):  Perform some limited setup for the reference manuals;
            some defaults are set here, but mostly this allows the "\," command
            to be used the way it is in the Python documentation.
    
            All future documentation should probably be written with only ","
            in the argument lists and not "\,".

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 11 19:29:11 1996 +0000

    Added 'strict_parsing' option to all parsing functions.  This causes a
    ValueError exception when the query string contains fields that don't
    contain exactly one '=' sign.  (By default, such fields are simply
    ignored.)  Added this to the doc string describing parse() and
    parse_qs().
    
    Also changed the default for keep_blank_values from None to 0 (the
    preferred way to spell 'FALSE').

    (myformat.perl):  Updated to allow library reference manual to be handled by

            of the smaller commands used in the library reference (\e, \optional).

    much identical anyway).
    Initialize PyMac_ApplicationPath and PyMac_ApplicationFSSpec to point

            handles that problem and does not affect the PostScript output.

    From: "Mark Hammond" <MHammond@skippinet.com.au>
    Date: Fri, 4 Oct 1996 09:08:19 +1000
    
    A couple of things.  As I mentioned a while back, I have made the
    changes to the registry support, in getpath_nt.c.  To recap, there can be:
    ...\pythonpath = default core Pythonpath
    ...\pythonpath\Pythonwin = c:\somewhere
    etc.
    
    The code simply appends them all.  The order can not be guaranteed
    (registry limitation) but the "default" is always at the end.
    
    The main reasons for change were the length of the path, but mainly
    so an uninstaller can do the right thing.

    Ellipses -> Ellipsis rename (the dictionary really says that it should
    be Ellipsis!).
    Bumped the API version because a linker-visible symbol is affected.
    Old C code will still compile -- there's a b/w compat macro.
    Similarly, old Python code will still run, builtin exports both
    Ellipses and Ellipsis.

            Added -3 option to generate HTML 3.0 constructs where meaningful.
    
            Removed repititive garbage generation:  the old version added simple
            descriptive comments after every datadesc/funcdesc/*desc entry:
    
            function(args) -- function of module xxxx
                Description....

    (texi2html.py):  Use "if __name__ == '__main__':" test.  Adjust indentation
            to 4 spaces per level (no longer 8).
    
    (Makefile):  Use .pyc versions of partparse.py and texi2html.py to generate

            working on the docs.

commit 8e44991b34d44038c50dcd6dc0ef806a82c1daa4
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 26 16:19:23 1996 +0000

    Three sets of changes from Grail:
    
    date: 1996/08/14 17:27:21;  author: fdrake;  state: Exp;  lines: +11 -9
    (formatter.py):  Establish a consistent space-handling policy, so that all
            spaces are handled by the outermost context in which they might be
            considered.  (I.e., softspaces at element boundaries migrate
            outwards.)
    
            For instance: "<A> <IMG> </A>" becomes " <A><IMG></A> ".
    
            This avoids some of those nasty underlined spaces around images.  It
            does not affect spaces *between* images within an anchor.
    
    date: 1996/08/01 17:02:09;  author: fdrake;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -2
    (formatter.py):  Added required parameter to the NullFormatter class; this
            was omitted by accident.
    
            Made AbstractFormatter.add_literal_data() handle preceeding softspace
            correctly instead of expecting the caller to do it.
    
    date: 1996/07/23 22:18:56;  author: fdrake;  state: Exp;  lines: +1 -1
    (formatter.py):  Correct assert_line_data() to update all internal conditions;
            This now handles headers with only image content immediately followed
            by anything.

    OK, now it uses sys.[exec_]prefix and supports

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 22:55:47 1996 +0000

    Add PYTHON_API_STRING, which is PYTHON_API_VERSION as a string literal.
    Under Windows, add MS_DLL_ID and MS_DLL_VERSION_ID for Mark H.
    
    Independent change: if Py_TRACE_REFS is defined, rename Py_InitModule4
    so so linking with incompatible modules will create a link time error.
    
    [Backing out of previous changes (also for modsupport.c) to test
    the latter at runtime.]

    Some more install changes:
    
    - "make install" now depends on "make altinstall" for most of the
    work, and the binary is always installed as python<version> first,
    with a hard link to python made by "make bininstall".
    
    - Create the machine dependent directory if it doesn't exist, and
    attempt to run the regen script in it (unfortunately this will fail
    unless you have h2py in your $PATH - help!)

    Append version number to library install directory.
    "make libinstall" no longer implies "make sharedinstall".
    "make altinstall" and "make altbininstall" install the python binary
    with a version number, for tentative installations (this does not
    install the include files or man page).

commit 4daf6adfe111af694af6152539567b59d09e29f1
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 24 02:33:33 1996 +0000

    Added version number to destination.
    
    Forget about the trick to create directories through dependencies --
    it's impossible to get it right in the light of parallellizing Make
    implementations and the inability to specify dependencies between
    directories (because creating the subdirectory modifies the parent).

commit a63d9f4d9fdd4d659d80628e4429129351fc61cb
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Jul 24 01:31:37 1996 +0000

    As a side effect of calling PySys_SetArgv (setpythonargv), the
    directory containing argv[0] is inserted in front of sys.path.
    If argv[0] contains no directory, an empty string is inserted.
    If argv is empty, nothing happens.

commit 4dd0bf92e613433cdd7806d46002a9bfe5e53fda
Author: Fred Drake <fdrake@acm.org>
Date:   Tue Jul 23 17:47:21 1996 +0000

    (rmt.py):  Updated to "modern" python coding conventions, somewhat.  Keyword
            arguments and explicit calls to .pack() are used; no more dictionaries
            are being passed to Tkinter constructors.  Otherwise, the example is
            unchanged.  (The app isn't implemented as a Python object.)

commit 99aa2a413258895725e0fe96a2ac182a024318f8
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Jul 23 17:27:05 1996 +0000

    Remove all CRLF -> LF translation for file uploads, since we cannot
    reliably distinguish binary files from text files (and Mac Netscape
    sends all files in "binary" form, i.e. it sends text files with only
    CR delimiters...).

commit 71e315b9d90aca5b5b74ca6cf78abf6f7be744b7
Author: Barry Warsaw <barry@python.org>
Date:   Tue Jul 23 15:03:16 1996 +0000

commit c7c5e697c364f0eb5420f9156432a6102ee0b593
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Jul 22 22:26:07 1996 +0000

    Optimizations and one intentional loophole by Jim Fulton.
    
    The optimizations consist mostly of using local variables to cache
    methods or instance variables used a lot (e.g. "self.write").
    
    The loopholes allows marshalling extension types as long as they have
    a __class__ attribute (in which case they may support the rest of the
    class piclking protocol as well).  This allows pickling MESS extension
    types.

    (2) more directories are built as needed;
    (3) the X11R5 shell script install-sh is used (always).
    (The script can't be called install.sh since some Make versions have a
    default rule that copies "foo.sh" to "foo" when making "foo".)
    
    Added target "smelly" which checks for non-Py-prefixed exported
    symbols.

commit 48766512a0b438b66e97dfdfcb933cd104baeffe
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 28 18:45:04 1996 +0000

    Reformatted with 4-space tab stops.
    
    Allow '=' and '~' in unquoted attribute values.
    
    Added overridable methods handle_starttag(tag, method, attrs) and
    handle_endtag(tag, method) so subclasses can decide whether they
    really want to call the method (e.g. when suppressing some portion of
    the document).
    
    Added support for a number of SGML shortcuts:
    
            shorthand               full notation
            <tag>...<>...           <tag>...<tag>...
            <tag>...</>             <tag>...</tag>
            <tag/.../               <tag>...</tag>
            <tag1<tag2>             <tag1><tag2>
            </tag1</tag2>           </tag1></tag2>
            </tag1<tag2>            </tag1><tag2>
    
    This required factoring out some common actions and rationalizing the
    interface to parse_endtag(), so as to make the code more readable.
    
    Fixed syntax for &entity and &#char references so the trailing
    semicolon is optional; removed explicit support for trailing period
    (which was a TBL mistake in HTML 0.0).
    
    Generalized the test program.
    
    Tried to speed things up a little.  (More to come after the profile
    results are in.)
    
    Fix error recovery: call the end methods popped from the stack instead
    of the one that triggers.  (Plus some complications because of the way
    HTML extensions are handled in Grail.)

commit e0371b8415650748f0e0718ff5160e286abaf753
Author: Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 10 10:36:07 1995 +0000

    Fixed basejoin.  There were two main problems:
    - basejoin('some/url', '#name') would strip the last component of
      some/url and resturn some/#name.
    - basejoin('file.html', 'relative/path') would return something like
      file:/relative/path, making a relative path into an absolute one.
    These bugs are fixed by some drastic changes.  No scheme is added when
    none is present (i.e. it works as replacement for posix.joinpath).
    If a scheme is present in the second argument, it is returned
    unprocessed.  No hostname are added in this case.  If no scheme is
    present, the scheme of the first argument, if present, is used.
    The algorithm is commented profusely.
    Also fixed a typo in a comment.

Author: Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 29 09:18:14 1995 +0000

    Implemented two new functions in sys:
            getcounts() returns a list of counts of allocations and
                    deallocations for all different object types.
            getobjects(n [, type ]) returns a list of recently allocated
                    and not-yet-freed objects of the given type (all
                    objects if no type given).  Only the n most recent
                    (all if n==0) objects are returned.
    getcounts is only available if compiled with -DCOUNT_ALLOCS,
    getobjects is only available if compiled with -DTRACE_REFS.  Note that
    everything must be compiled with these options!

Date:   Sun Jan 22 18:42:12 1995 +0000

    Got rid of {Get,Set}FileType in favor of {Get,Set}CreatorAndType --
    the former had their arguments reversed compared to all Apple's
    routines (e.g. FSpOpenResFile()).
    
    Also fixed the SoundMgr UserRoutine (Jack fixed it but put the fix
    between #ifdef __MWERKS__ ... #endif :-( ).
    
    NB eventually this module should disappear in favor of separate
    modules per manager (e.g. Resources, Sound, Files, ...).

    The great renaming, phase two: all header files have been updated to
    use the new names exclusively, and the linker will see the new names.
    Files that import "Python.h" also only see the new names.  Files that
    import "allobjects.h" will continue to be able to use the old names,
    due to the inclusion (in allobjects.h) of "rename2.h".

    Support for new sys.path code in config.c

commit c5b26f4a05f6cfcc3fbf474d70af57d42f7a1439
Author: Jack Jansen <jack.jansen@cwi.nl>
Date:   Wed Dec 14 13:45:11 1994 +0000

    - PYTHONPATH is now \n-separated, so you can have directories with
      spaces in the name.
    - If you run python with a script the working directory is now the
      directory where the script lives (was: directory where python
      application lives). sys.path will include current dir, application
      dir and Lib, etc. relative to application dir. This is more like
      unix python does things and more useful besides (since you can
      easily import files living in the same directory as the importer).
    - Added the macconsole, ctb, macspeech, macdnr and mactcp modules.
    - For MW compiler, put 68K/PPC indication in version string.

            * Python/ceval.c, Include/ceval.h: promote MakePendingCalls to

            Python/{ceval.c,bltinmodule.c}: entirely redone operator
            overloading.  The rules for class instances are now much more

            arguments without surrounding parentheses
            (when called as newgetargs()), and better error messages

            entirely redone operator overloading.  The rules for class
            instances are now much more relaxed than for other built-in types
            (whose coerce must still return two objects of the same type)
    
            * Objects/floatobject.c: add overflow check when converting float
            to int and implement truncation towards zero using ceil/float
    
            * Objects/longobject.c: change ValueError to OverflowError when
            converting to int
    
            * Objects/rangeobject.c: modernized
    
            * Objects/stringobject.c: use HAVE_LIMITS instead of __STDC__

    MPW changes

commit 8e1f8dd094f2a29f779bcee2868ffe3898f0866e
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 29 09:14:14 1994 +0000

    Restructured MPW notes

commit 8ce65b4cde000e8648fdccf5371509c5953551d1
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 29 08:58:39 1994 +0000

    README, Makfiles and `buildall' script to build Python under MPW 3.2.

commit 739267b7c34c0bdf934059804fde3f027e84bd0b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Aug 29 08:42:37 1994 +0000

    Completed (hopefully) the unification of THINK 6.0 and MPW 3.2
    versions -- they now share config.c and config.h, and statting is
    always done through macstat.[ch] (THINK's <stat.h> defines funny
    constants).  Also the configuration of stdwin is done differently: you
    have to define USE_STDWIN to the compiler prefix.

commit e78344444086581bdf59f13415b0c701e740cce1
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

Date:   Tue Aug 23 14:06:18 1994 +0000

            * configure.in, */Makefile*.in: OPT can now be specified in the
            env at configure time and will then be put in all Makefiles as
            default
            * */Makefile*.in: remove lib*.a before adding to it

commit c561e5dd58ed17ecf0f8fe31b366082bc311e0d9

            I'd done that already?!); disable gdbm by default
            * configure.in, */Makefile*.in: OPT can now be specified in the

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 23 13:49:15 1994 +0000

            * Modules/makesetup: support C++ files now; these should be given
            as file.C or file.cc or file.c++; C files can be given as file.c
            (instead of file.o, which is still supported)

            * Lib/macpath.py: don't return trailing colon for dirname()

            loops forever)
            * Lib/traceback.py: print SyntaxError correctly
            * Lib/stat.py: moved to posixstat.py; added macstat.py which has
            the constants for the Mac; and created new stat.py which includes
            the right one
            * Lib/urllib.py: fix caching bug (by disabling the cache)

commit 9e1e149a5fbb0b24c4f3b7a2cc52e5236a715ee4
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 23 13:29:21 1994 +0000

            * Lib/sgi/flp.py: fix caching bug (always write the whole file to

            * Doc/libtime.tex: get rid of references to millitime() and
            millisleep(); document clock()
    
            * Doc/ref6.tex (section{Assignment statements}): added warning
            about overlaps in lhs of assignment (e.g. "i, x[i] = 1, 2")

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Aug 18 15:42:46 1994 +0000

    Changes to make it work and compile on NT, by Mark Hammond.
    (NT changes for posixmodule.c re-invented by Guido.)

commit 8a38a6b99fad747a53022b5aca8c4623bd22b377
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 17 14:39:22 1994 +0000

    Added #diagram:... comments for Kees Blom's railroad diagram generator

commit 2828e9dbd4899eb28d63ec1ba246800b0b14c694
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 17 13:16:34 1994 +0000

            * Doc/libstring.tex (section{Standard Module \sectcode{string}}):
            removed references to {ato{f,i,l},index}_error

commit 710c352d058856830e7c003bce7cccd4c10024ea
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 17 13:16:11 1994 +0000

            * Lib/string.py: find/rfind is now the main implementation and
            index/rindex is a wrapper that raises index_error (which is now
            always ValueError)

commit 5806a4f5c3d0921d66e68dbf97083c1f0f80f1b9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 17 13:15:46 1994 +0000

            * Modules/stropmodule.c: implement find/rfind instead of
            index/rindex (raising and catching an exception is much more
            expensive than returning and testing -1)

commit 3d67feed24d53d793f8367164b65f93d8407905b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Aug 17 12:19:53 1994 +0000

    1.12 -- new address for fu-berlin mirror, infoseek uses python, more
    info about windows stdwin, more about gnu getopt, correct typo

commit 2d3a94010f1b72683fca2d734239c87584129a10

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

    Added docs for delattr

commit 91ab4a8353447f265a7559a4769ac5404bb0b157
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Aug 16 22:13:47 1994 +0000

    If an attribute is deleted, __setattr__ is called with 2 instead of 3
    arguments (adding __delattr__ was deemed too much overhead)

commit fda5fb21583934d4a82f61e58a6706eeda0aca87
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 12 13:18:41 1994 +0000

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 12 13:18:25 1994 +0000

            * configure.in, Makefile.in: remove the AC_PREFIX() call -- it's
            more trouble than it's worth at CWI and most other people seem to
            install Python in the default (/usr/local) anway.  Changed comment
            describing --prefix in Makefile.in

commit 3f9a6ec9e672acb733db1633d5544120e1bd6841
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 12 13:16:50 1994 +0000

            * Lib/rfc822.py: fix two bugs: error in readheaders interpreting
            regex.match() result, and wrong logic in getfirstmatchingheader()
            when the same header occurs twice consecutively

    Test set for new pow() function

commit b8b264b165fea8edd388886025615fc1fbcb603c
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 12 13:13:50 1994 +0000

            * Doc/libfuncs.tex: don't use $math$ in description of pow(x,y,z);
            describe tuple()
    
            * Doc/libposixfile.tex: use tableiii instead of tableii, so
            partparse will work again (I know, chicken!)
    
            * Doc/libthread.tex: Added get_ident(); updated text on module
            availability
    
            * Doc/myformat.perl: Added sub do_cmd_Cpp

    New patches by Andrew to fix various problems

commit e149fa2a1e34d18497579fff198c7ac2feb19096
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Aug 12 12:49:46 1994 +0000

            * Objects/classobject.c, Include/classobject.h: added __getattr__
            and __setattr__ support to override getattr(x, name) and
            setattr(x, name, value) for class instances.  This uses a special
            hack whereby the class is supposed to be static: the __getattr__
            and __setattr__ methods are looked up only once and saved in the
            instance structure for speed

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>

            * tkintermodule.c (*FileHandler): generalize to arbitrary file ids
            and objects that hav a fileno() method; fix bug in FileHandler
            (should call XDECREF instead of DECREF)

            * Objects/{int,long,float}object.c, Include/object.h,
            Python/bltinmodule.c: mods by Andrew Kuchling to implement
            pow(x,y,z) == pow(x,y)%z, but without incurring overflow

            * Modules/{Setup.in, gdbmmodule.c}, Doc/{lib,libgdbm}.tex: added
            Anthony Baxter's gdbm module (derived from Jack's dbm module)

            * Modules/{Setup.in,Makefile.pre.in}: renamed some modules to
            shorter names (dropped the "module" from the name): sunaudiodev,

            * tkintermodule.c: OK, I've fixed the "tty" problem.  You're right
            no need for the stdin handler, a Tk_DoOneEvent(TK_DONT_WAIT) did
            the trick.  I've included a diff to tkintermodule.c.

    Version 1.11 -- added several new answers on design questions

commit 5f47e5752a31dda81e20a21ed9dc33d0fa9b0db7
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Jul 14 14:01:00 1994 +0000

            * Lib/mhlib.py (removefromallsequences): call putsequences with
            proper argument
    
            * Lib/{bdb,cmd,pdb}.py: Mods by Rickard Westman: No longer barfs
            on lambda:s (outputs "<lambda>" as the function name); "a(rgs)" in
            pdb now works; help messages added to pdb (lifted from pdb.doc).
            Also, "h pdb" calls pdb.help().  cmd.do_help() displays topics on
            a nicer way (I think).  Also, topics for which there is a help_
            method, but no do_method (like "pdb" above) are displayed in a
            special way.  My own mod: fix break on function to also support
            methods.

    Use disabled state to enforce read-only state (bit painful since it means
    switching states each time we insert some text but has to be done this way

    Rewritten somewhat again, distinguished between internal and external
    methods (internal ones start with '_'), asynchronous transfers are now
    killed synchronously (i.e. after t.kill(), t.busy() is false immediately).

            (Tk.destroy): master is always None; so don't del.  Found by
            Tommy Burnette, solution from Guido van Rossum.
            (Misc.selection_get): Missing return.  Found by Richard Neitzel.
            (Misc._options, Widget.config, Canvas._create):  If cnf is a tuple
            or list then merge the contents.  Suggested by Matthew Conway.

            pathnames.
            Renamed __del__() to destroy() (because of circular refs, __del__
            won't ever be called).
            Added some names with explicit _set: focus_set, focus_default_set,
            grab_set.
            Added focus_default_none.
            (Misc._getints): use tk.splitlist() instead of tk.split(), return
            None if string empty.

    name on "fast variable not found", AND use "__call__" method if it
    exists to call an inmstance.  Whew!

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 30 13:43:54 1993 +0000

    * test_*.py: new lambda syntax (also affects tests for filter, map,
      reduce)
    * ftplib.py: added default callback for retrlines; added dir() method
    * ftplib.py: don't return self in self.connect(); added hack so that if
      'CDUP' is not understood, 'CWD ..' is tried.
    * ftplib.py: second method called init() should have been called
      connect(); if __init__ sees more than one argument, it will also try to
      login().

      removed implied lambda for string arg to filter/map/reduce.
    * Grammar, graminit.[ch], compile.[ch]: replaced lambda as built-in
      function by lambda as grammar entity: instead of "lambda('x: x+1')" you
      write "lambda x: x+1".
    * Xtmodule.c (checkargdict): return 0, not NULL, for error.

    * timemodule.c: Add hack for Solaris 2.
    * posixmodule.c: don't prototype getcwd() -- it's not portable...
    * mappingobject.c: double-check validity of last_name_char in
      dict{lookup,insert,remove}.
    * arraymodule.c: need memmove only for non-STDC Suns.
    * Makefile: comment out HTML_LIBS and XT_USE by default
    * pythonmain.c: don't prototype getopt() -- it's not standardized
    * socketmodule.c: cast flags arg to {get,set}sockopt() and addrbuf arg to
      recvfrom() to (ANY*).
    * pythonrun.c (initsigs): fix prototype, make it static
    * intobject.c (LONG_BIT): only #define it if not already defined
    * classobject.[ch]: remove all references to unused instance_convert()
    * mappingobject.c (getmappingsize): Don't return NULL in int function.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Nov 23 16:28:45 1993 +0000

    * {lib,ref,ext,tut}.tex: added explicit \date{<date> \\ <release>}.
    * lib2.tex: change bogus \\var to \var.

    * text2latex.py: call main() instead of always processing ext.tex.
    * Makefile: added 'ext' to 'all' target
    * ext.tex: more changes towards a readable text

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed Nov 17 22:58:56 1993 +0000

    * import.c (get_module): total rewrite, to ensure proper search order: for
      each dir in sys.path, try each possible extension.  (Note: C extensions
      are loaded before Python modules in the same directory, to allow having
      a C version used when dynamic loading is supported and a Python version
      as a back-up.)
    * import.c (reload_module): test for error from getmodulename()
    * moduleobject.c: implement module name as dict entry '__name__' instead
      of special-casing it in module_getattr(); this way a module (or
      function!) can access its own module name, and programs that know what
      they are doing can rename modules.
    * stdwinmodule.c (initstdwin): strip ".py" suffix of argv[0].

    * parsermodule.c, Makefile, config.c: rudimentary interface to the Python
      parser.
    * mappingobject.c (lookmapping): 'freeslot' was never used due to a bug in
      the code.

    * string.py: added rindex(), rfind(); changed index() to interpret
      negative start indices starting from the right.
    * ftplib.py: debug() -> set_debuglevel(); change demo to use __init__().
    * os.py: added execl, execlp, and execvp.

    * ext.tex: did most of the tedious changes from plain ASCII text to LaTeX.
    * text2latex.py: automatically put function names in \code{}.
    * lib.tex, ref.tex, ext.tex, qua.tex, tut.tex: use new P.O.Box number in
      address.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 5 14:45:11 1993 +0000

    * ext.tex: documentation for extending, reference counts, and embedding
      (formerly ../misc/{EXTENDING,REFCNT,EMBEDDING}).  Also affects Makefile.
    * text2latex.py: script to do part of the conversion from an plain ASCI
      text file (in my particular style) to LaTeX.
      (Chapter/section/subsection headers, and verbatim sections.)
    * partparse.py, texipre.dat, fix.el, Makefile: Minor cleanup of latex ->
      info conversion process (at least it works again, and with less
      debugging output).  Removed fix.sh.
    * lib1.tex (section{Built-in Functions}): adapt description of str() and
      repr() to new situation.
    * lib3.tex (Module os): added exec*() variants.
    * lib3.tex (Module posix): added execve().
    * lib2.tex (Module array): documented reality; remove typecode and
    itemsize, add byteswap, rename read/write to fromfile/tofile, and
    re-alphabetized.
    * lib1.tex (Built-in Functions): renamed bagof() to filter().

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri Nov 5 10:22:19 1993 +0000

    * mpzmodule.c: removed redundant mpz_print function.
    * object.[ch], bltinmodule.c, fileobject.c: changed str() to call
      strobject() which calls an object's __str__ method if it has one.
      strobject() is also called by writeobject() when PRINT_RAW is passed.
    * ceval.c: rationalize code for PRINT_ITEM (no change in function!)
    * funcobject.c, codeobject.c: added compare and hash functionality.
      Functions with identical code objects and the same global dictionary are
      equal.  Code objects are equal when their code, constants list and names
      list are identical (i.e. the filename and code name don't count).
      (hash doesn't work yet since the constants are in a list and lists can't
      be hashed -- suppose this should really be done with a tuple now we have
      resizetuple!)

    * nismodule.c: database keys and values can contain null bytes.  be more
      careful about these.
    * arraymodule.c: added 8 byte swap; added 'i' format character; added
      reverse() method; rename read/write to fromfile/tofile.
    * config.c: Set version to 0.9.9++.
    * rotormodule.c (r_rand): declare k1..k5 as unsigned longs so the shifts
      will have a well-defined effect independent of word size.
    * bltinmodule.c: renamed bagof() to filter().

    * listobject.c (list_ass_slice): XDECREF instead of DECREF so

    intobject.c: Save references to small integers, so that they can be
            shared.  The default is to save references to the integers in
            the range -1..99.  The lower limit can be set by defining
            NSMALLNEGINTS (absolute value of smallest integer to be saved)
            and NSMALLPOSINTS (1 more than the largest integer to be
            saved).
    tupleobject.c: Save a reference to the empty tuple to be returned
            whenever a tuple of size 0 is requested.  Tuples of size 1
            upto, but not including, MAXSAVESIZE (default 20) are put in
            free lists when deallocated.  When MAXSAVESIZE equals 1, only
            share references to the empty tuple, when MAXSAVESIZE equals
            0, don't include the code at all and revert to the old
            behavior.
    object.c: Print some more statistics when COUNT_ALLOCS is defined.

    without .py file); Bill's dynamic loading for SunOS using shared
    libraries.

    classobject.c (instance_getattr): Fix case when class lookup returns
    unbound method instead of function.

      image objects, and lots of new methods.
    * Added counting of allocations and deallocations of builtin types if

    VCR.py: Use unix files instead of stdio files for tty communication,
            because of buffering.  Also added several new commands (Jack).
    VFile.py: Made setting of RGB or colormap mode separate methods,
            so they can be overridden (e.g. when using the Glx.draw widget
            the way to change the mode is totally different).

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Jun 1 13:21:04 1993 +0000

    * toaiff.py: import whatsound instead of sndhdr
    * sndhdr.py: renamed to whatsound.py; use new aifc module for AIFF/AIFC
    * ftplib.py: added close() (closes without sending QUIT command)
    * aifc.py: documented close()

    New class syntax

commit eb6b33a837a180221b635331e005f990024bdb30
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue May 25 09:38:27 1993 +0000

    * classobject.c: in instance_getattr, don't make a method out of a
      function found as instance data.
    * socketmodule.c: added 'flags' argument sendto/recvfrom, rewrite
      argument parsing in send/recv.
    * More changes related to access (terminology change: owner instead of
      class; allow any object as owner; local/global variables are owned
      by their dictionary, only class/instance data is owned by the class;
      "from...import *" now only imports objects with public access; etc.)

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon May 24 14:16:22 1993 +0000

    * ftplib.py: added abort() command (sends oob data).
    * Several modules: change "class C(): ..." to "class C: ...".
    * flp.py: support for frozen forms.
    * Added string.find() which is like index but returns -1 if not found

commit b3f7258f14cb2f3e52236a4087ed82541a173e7b
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Fri May 21 19:56:10 1993 +0000

    * Lots of small changes related to access.
    * Added "access *: ...", made access work for class methods.
    * Introduced subclass check: make sure that when calling
      ClassName.methodname(instance, ...), the instance is an instance of
      ClassName or of a subclass thereof (this might break some old code!)

commit 81daa32c15cfa9f05eda037916cdbfd5b4323431
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu May 20 14:24:46 1993 +0000

    Access checks now work, at least for instance data (not for methods
    yet).  The class is now passed to eval_code and stored in the current
    frame.  It is also stored in instance method objects.  An "unbound"
    instance method is now returned when a function is retrieved through
    "classname.funcname", which when called passes the class to eval_code.

commit 25831652fd4c03323066d4cafdc0551c396a993e
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Wed May 19 14:50:45 1993 +0000

    Several changes in one:
    
    (1) dictionaries/mappings now have attributes values() and items() as
    well as keys(); at the C level, use the new function mappinggetnext()
    to iterate over a dictionary.
    
    (2) "class C(): ..." is now illegal; you must write "class C: ...".
    
    (3) Class objects now know their own name (finally!); and minor
    improvements to the way how classes, functions and methods are
    represented as strings.
    
    (4) Added an "access" statement and semantics.  (This is still
    experimental -- as long as you don't use the keyword 'access' nothing
    should be changed.)

    Implemented VCR capture using forward slow instead of stepping.
    Also added a 'rate' field to specify the capture rate in this case.

Date:   Fri May 7 09:37:42 1993 +0000

    All combinations of video format and capture mode (cont/burst) now
    work.  Reorganized a lot of the code, still not satisfied...

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu May 6 16:27:25 1993 +0000

    Use groups to show/hide "Stop capture" button.
    Made mono capture work.
    Don't support rgb24 capture (the code for this doesn't exist in Vrec either!).

    (I suggest a recompile after getting this, the ceval.c bugfix may be crucial!)
    
    * Makefile: removed superfluous AR=ar, fixed misleading comment.
    * ceval.c: fixed debugging code; save/restore errors in locals_2_fast.
    * intrcheck.c: for SunOS etc., turn off syscall resumption.
    * regexpr.h: bump number of registers to 100.

commit 8379ed5f0277c4f0e7d6440b48ca3f67636a42e9
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 30 19:13:03 1993 +0000

    Updated because of new opcodes introduced for "fast" local variables.

commit 5b7221849e240c2a62ebbc48d58607417b42ef44
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 30 17:46:03 1993 +0000

    * Fixed some subtleties with fastlocals.  You can no longer access
      f_fastlocals in a traceback object (this is a core dump hazard
      if there are <nil> entries), but instead eval_code() merges the fast
      locals back into the locals dictionary if it looks like the local
      variables will be retained.  Also, the merge routines save
      exceptions since this is sometimes needed (alas!).
    
    * Added id() to bltinmodule.c, which returns an object's address
      (identity).  Useful to walk arbitrary data structures containing
      cycles.
    
    * Added compile() to bltinmodule.c and compile_string() to
      pythonrun.[ch]: support to exec/eval arbitrary code objects.  The
      code that defaults globals and locals is moved from run_node in
      pythonrun.c (which is now identical to eval_node) to eval_code in
      ceval.c.  [XXX For elegance a clean-up session is necessary.]

commit 8b17d6bd89cd79820c76bd88bc064e44fc03a1bd
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 30 13:18:41 1993 +0000

    Changes to speed up local variables enormously, by avoiding dictionary
    lookup (opcode.h, ceval.[ch], compile.c, frameobject.[ch],
    pythonrun.c, import.c).  The .pyc MAGIC number is changed again.
    Added get_menu_text to flmodule.

    * Fix bug in tzparse.py for DST timezone
    * Added whatis command to pdb.py
    * new module GET.py (GL definitions from <gl/get.h>)
    * rect.py: is_empty takes a rect as argument, not two points.
    * Added tests for builtin round() [XXX not yet complete!]

Author: Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
Date:   Mon Mar 29 10:49:59 1993 +0000

    Added some error checking.

commit 9bfef44d97d1ae24e03717e3d59024b44626a9de
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Mar 29 10:43:31 1993 +0000

    * Changed all copyright messages to include 1993.
    * Stubs for faster implementation of local variables (not yet finished)
    * Added function name to code object.  Print it for code and function
      objects.  THIS MAKES THE .PYC FILE FORMAT INCOMPATIBLE (the version
      number has changed accordingly)
    * Print address of self for built-in methods
    * New internal functions getattro and setattro (getattr/setattr with
      string object arg)
    * Replaced "dictobject" with more powerful "mappingobject"
    * New per-type functio tp_hash to implement arbitrary object hashing,
      and hashobject() to interface to it
    * Added built-in functions hash(v) and hasattr(v, 'name')
    * classobject: made some functions static that accidentally weren't;
      added __hash__ special instance method to implement hash()
    * Added proper comparison for built-in methods and functions

    Added support for "compress" type video files.  This uses the
    Compression Library to decompress the images.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 16 12:15:04 1993 +0000

    * Changed many files to use mkvalue() instead of newtupleobject().
    * Fixcprt.py: added [-y file] option, do only files younger than file.
    * modsupport.[ch]: added vmkvalue().
    * intobject.c: use mkvalue().
    * stringobject.c: added "formatstring"; renamed string* to string_*;
      ceval.c: call formatstring for string % value.
    * longobject.c: close memory leak in divmod.
    * parsetok.c: set result node to NULL when returning an error.

Date:   Thu Feb 25 16:10:16 1993 +0000

    Vrec.py, Vrecb.py:
             - call v.SetParam() after v.BindGLWindow()
             - turn of dithering in mono/grey mode
             - use prefposition to place the top left corner at (150, 150)
               (so that the video remains visible during recording)
             - default width is 256
    Vcopy.py: correct typos; more verbose output.
    OldVcopy.py: new name for Jack's old grabbing Vcopy.py.
    Vstat.py: print values of all video parameters.

    Change Vinfo and Vaddcache to usr /ufs/guido/bin/sgi/python.
    Don't force packfactor to 1 in header when writing rgb data.
    Small bugfixes in Vcopy.

commit 5e044b7009e40c38e488c658f6fda34920dbce36
Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Thu Feb 25 14:20:13 1993 +0000

    - Separated grabbing (which isn't used much!) from VFile.
    - Renamed old Vcopy.py to OldVcopy.py, some cosmetic changes to it (is
      it still needed?)
    - Added new Vcopy.py which does everything that Vtime.py does but also
      format conversions, image scaling, and packfactors.
    - VFile: make packfactor always a tuple; introduce set and get methods
      for pf, format, and calculate some derived values.
    - Added new module GET.py to std library, use it instead of defining
      DM* in VFile.
    - Get rid of C programs (new Python programs can do all that they do
      and they probably don't understand the current file format anyway).

    * clmodule.c: the documentation was wrong, so changed the interface
      accordingly: SetMin, SetMax, SetDefault are no longer methods of the
      compressor/decompressor but are functions of the cl module and they
      take a first argument which is a compression scheme

    * clmodule.c: use function prototypes (found and fixed some bugs this
      way); more efficiently check whether parameters are float; removed
      one argument from DecompressImage method; use clGetParam instead of
      clGetParams where it makes sense; convert int parameters in
      SetParams, SetParam, SetMin, SetMax, and SetDefault to float when
      needed; added QuerySchemeFromHandle method
    * Makefile: interchanged cstubs and cgen.py so that $> in rule gets
      them in the right order

Date:   Fri Feb 12 16:29:05 1993 +0000

    bltinmodule.c: added round(x, [n]); coerce() of two class instances

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Feb 8 15:49:17 1993 +0000

    * stdwinmodule.c: various new commands: setwin{pos,size},
      listfontnames, bitmap ops.
    * listobject.c: use mkvalue() when possible; avoid weird error when
      calling append() without args.
    * modsupport.c: new feature in getargs(): if the format string
      contains a semicolor the string after that is used as the error
      message instead of "bad argument list (format %s)" when there's an
      error.

Author: Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
Date:   Wed Jan 6 13:36:38 1993 +0000

    Various changes.
    * Makefile: svmodule.c.proto and svgen.py are gone, svmodule.c came in
            their stead.  Also, pass -DUSE_DL flag to thread.c and give
            the user a possibility to add the -DDEBUG to just thread.c.
    * ceval.c: init_save_thread() can be called more than once now.
    * svgen.py, svmodule.c.proto, svmodule.c: Removed prototype file and
            replaced it by the generated file.
    * thread.c: Added some more checks; added call to DL library when it
            is also used to tell it where the shared arena is so that DL
            can use some other area.
    * threadmodule.c: Call init_save_thread from another place.  Also,
            added new function getlocklock() which does to lock objects
            what getfilefile does to file objects.

Date:   Mon Jan 4 09:16:51 1993 +0000

    * More changes due to stricter argument passing rules
    * Fixed calendar.py, mimetools.py, whrandom.py to cope with time.time()
      returning a floating point number.  (And fix old bug in calendar)
    * Add recursion level to mainloop.mainloop(), to make it reentrant.

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 4 09:09:59 1993 +0000

    * Configure.py: use #!/usr/local/bin/python
    * posixmodule.c: move extern function declarations to top
    * listobject.c: cmp() arguments must be void* if __STDC__
    * Makefile, allobjects.h, panelmodule.c, modsupport.c: get rid of
      strdup() -- it is a portability risk
    * Makefile: enclosed ranlib command in parentheses for Sequent Make
      which aborts if the command is not found even if '-' is present
    * timemodule.c: time() returns a floating point number, in microsecond
      precision if BSD_TIME is defined.

    * mymalloc.h: always allocate one extra byte, since some malloc's
      return NULL for malloc(0) or realloc(p, 0).  (This should be done
      differently than wasting one byte, but alas...)
    * Moved "add'l libraries" option in Makefile to an earlier place.
    * Remove argument compatibility hacks (b) and (c).
    * Add grey2mono, dither2mono and mono2grey to imageop.
    * Dup the fd in socket.fromfd().

      Makefile and config.c.
    * socketmodule.c: added socket.fromfd(fd, family, type, [proto]),
      converted socket() to use of getargs().

    * Got entirely rid of path.py.
    * Many modules: fixes for new, stricter, argument passing rules
      (most changes were automatic ones -- not all of this is tested!).
    * gwin.py: now uses mainloop.py for its main loop and window admin.
    * mainloop.py: always call dispatch() with event as a tuple!
    * Fix bug in pdb's 'clear' command -- don't set the bpt but clear it!

    a FILE* argument now take an object* argument.

    If a type has a repr function but no print function, printing it now
    calls the repr function.  When the refcount is bad, don't print
    the object at all (chances of crashes).
    Changes to checking and printing of references: the consistency
    check is somewhat faster; don't print strings referenced once
    (most occur in function's name lists).

    * renamed malloc.h mymalloc.h, and added MALLARG as the type of the
      argument to malloc() (size_t or unsigned int)
    
    * listobject.c: check for overflow of the size of the object,

      of calling malloc() with -4 (and then crashing -- malloc's fault)

    Wanneer er geen disk in de speler zit falen sommige routines.  De
    exceptie heeft nu in dat geval als argument "no disc in player", behalve
    wanneer de bibliotheek routine errno zet.  In dat laatste geval wordt
    (nog steeds) err_errno() gebruikt.
    
    Wanneer een routine uit de bibliotheek faalt wordt nu altijd een IOError
    gegenereerd.  Een RuntimeError treedt alleen op bij verkeerde argumenten.
